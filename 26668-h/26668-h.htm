<h3>OF SUNDRY MY ADVENTURES FROM THE TIME OF MY
GOING ABROAD UNTIL MY COMING TO MAN'S ESTATE
(WHICH WAS ALL THE ESTATE I HAD).</h3>



<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A Strange</span> Nursing-mother&mdash;rather a Stepmother
of the Stoniest sort&mdash;was this Sir
Basil Hopwood, Knight and Alderman of
London, that contracted with the Government
to take us Transports abroad. Sure
there never was a man, on this side the land
of Horseleeches, that was so Hungry after
money. Yet was his avarice not of the
kind practised by old Audley, the money-scrivener<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of the Commonwealth's time; or
Hopkins, the wretch that saved candles' ends
and yet had a thousand wax-lights blazing
at his Funeral; or Guy the Bookseller, that
founded the Hospital in Southwark; or even
old John Elwes, Esquire, the admired Miser
of these latter days. Sir Basil Hopwood
was the rather of the same complexion of
Entrails with that Signor Volpone whom
we have all seen&mdash;at least such of us as be
old Boys&mdash;in Ben Jonson's play of the <i>Fox</i>.
He Money-grubbed, and Money-clutched,
and Money-wrung, ay, and in a manner
Money-stole, that he might live largely, and
ruffle it among his brother Cits in surpassing
state and splendour. He had been Lord
Mayor; and on his Show-day the Equipments
of chivalry had been more Sumptuous,
the Banners more varied, the Entertainment
at Saddlers' Hall,&mdash;where the Lord
Mayor was wont to hold his Feast before
the present Mansion House was built, the
ancient Guildhall in King Street being then
but in an ill condition for banquet,&mdash;Hopwood's
Entertainment, I say, had been more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
plentifully provided with Marrowbones, Custards,
Ruffs and Reeves, Baked Cygnets,
Malmsey, Canary, and Hippocras, than had
ever been known since the days of the Merry
Mayor, who swore that King Charles the
Second should take t'other bottle. He was
a Parliament man, too, and had a Borough
in his Pocket, for the which he kept a Warming-Pan
member,&mdash;more's the shame,&mdash;besides
one to serve him as a cushion to sit on.</div>

<p>This enormously rich man had a fine
House in Bishopsgate Street, with as many
rogues in blue liveries as a Rotterdam Syndic
that has made three good ventures in
Java. When we poor wretches, chained
together, had been brought up in Carts from
Aylesbury to London, on our way to be
Embarked, nothing would serve this Haughty
and Purse-proud Citizen but that our ragged
Regiment must halt before his peddling
Palace; and there the varlets in blue that
attended upon him brought us out Loaves
and Cheese, and Blackjacks full of two-thread
Beer, which, with many disdainful gestures
and uncivil words, they offered to our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
famished lips. And my Lady Hopwood,
and the fine Madams her daughters,&mdash;all
laced and furbelowed, and with widows' and
orphans' tears, and the blood-drops of
crimped seamen and kidnapped children,
twinkling in their Stomachers for gems,&mdash;were
all set at their Bowery window, a
pudding-fed Chaplain standing bowing and
smirking behind them, and glozing in their
ears no doubt Praises of their exceeding
Charity and Humanity to wretches such as
we were. But this Charity, Jack, says I to
myself, is not of the Shapcott sort, and is
but base metal after all. My troth, but we
wanted the Bread and Cheese and Swipes;
for we had had neither Bite nor Sup since
we left Aylesbury Gaol seven-and-twenty
hours agone. So, after a while, and the mob
hallooing at us for Gallows-birds, and some
Ruffians about the South-Sea House pelting
us with stones,&mdash;for Luck, as they said,&mdash;we
were had over London Bridge,&mdash;where
with dreadful admiration I viewed the Heads
and Quarters of Traitors, all shimmering in
the coat of pitch i' the Sun over the North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Turret,&mdash;and were bestowed for the night in
the Borough Clink. And hither we were
pursued by the Alderman's Agents, who
straightway began to drive Unholy Bargains
with those among us that had Money. Now
'twas selling them Necessaries for the
voyage at exorbitant rates; or promising
them, for cash in hand, to deliver them
Luxuries, such as Tobacco, playing-cards,
and strong waters, at the Port of Embarkation.
Now 'twas substituting Light for
Heavy Fetters, if the Heaviness could be
Assuaged by Gold; and sometimes even
negotiations were carried so far as for the
convicted persons to give Drafts of Exchange,
to be honoured by their Agents in London,
so soon as word came from the Plantations
that they had been placed in Tolerable
Servitude, instead of Agonising Slavery.
For although there was then, as there is
now, a convenient Fiction that a Felon's
goods became at once forfeit to the Crown,
I never yet knew a Felon (and I have known
many) that felt ever so little difficulty in
keeping his property, if he had any, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
disposing of it according to his own Good
Will and Pleasure.</p>

<p>The Head Gaoler of the Borough Clink&mdash;I
know not how his Proper official title
ran&mdash;was a colonel in the Foot Guards, who
lived in Jermyn Street, St. James's, and
transacted most of his High and Mighty
business either at Poingdestre's Ordinary in
St. Alban's Place, or at White's Chocolate
House, to say naught of the Rose, or the
Key in Chandos Street. Much, truly, did
he concern himself about his unhappy Captives.
His place was a Patent one, and was
worth to him about Fifteen Hundred a year,
at which sum it was farmed by Sir Basil
Hopwood; who, in his turn, on the principle
that "'tis scurvy money that won't stick to
your fingers," underlet the place to a Company
of Four Rogues, who gave him Two
Thousand for that, which they managed to
swell into at least Three for themselves by
squeezing of Poor Prisoners, and the like
crying Injustices. 'Twas Aylesbury Gaol
over again, with the newest improvements
and the Humours of the Town added to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
So, when Sir Basil Hopwood took up a cargo
of cast persons for Transportation, his underlings
of the Borough Clink were only
too glad to harbour them for a night or
two, making a pretty profit out of the poor
creatures. For all which, I doubt it not,
Sir Basil Hopwood and his scoundrelly
Myrmidons are, at this instant moment,
Howling.</p>

<p>This place was a prison for Debtors as well
as Criminals, and was to the full as Foul as
the Tophet-pit at Aylesbury yonder. I
had not been there half an hour before a
Lively companion of a Gentleman Cutpurse,
with a wrench at my kerchief, a twist at
my arm (which nearly Broke it in twain),
and a smart Blow under my Lower Jaw,
robs me of the packet of comforts (clothing,
pressed beef, sugar, comfits, and the
like) which my kind friends at Aylesbury
had given me. The Rascal comes to me a
few minutes afterwards with a packet of
Soap and a Testament, which he had taken
from my Bundle, and returns them to me
with a Grin, telling me that it was long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
since his Body had felt need of the one or
his Soul of the other. And yet I think
they would have profited considerably (pending
a Right Cord) by the application of
Both. So I in a corner, to moan and whimper
at my Distressed condition.</p>

<p>A sad Sunday I spent in the Clink,&mdash;'twas
on the Monday we were to start,&mdash;although,
to some other of my companions,
the Time passed jovially enough. For very
many of the Relations and Friends of the
Detained Persons came to visit them, bringing
them money, victuals, clothing, and
other Refreshments. 'Twas on this day
I heard that one of us, who was cast for
Forgery, had been offered a Free Pardon
if he could lodge Five Hundred Pounds in
the hands of a Person who had Great Influence
near a Great Man.</p>

<p>Late on the Sunday afternoon, Sir Basil
Hopwood came down in his coach, and with
his chaplain attendant on him. We Convicts
were all had to the Grate, for the
Knight and Alderman would not venture
further in, for fear of the Gaol Fever; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
he makes us a Fine Speech about the King's
Mercy,&mdash;which I deny not,&mdash;and his own
Infinite Goodness in providing for us in a
Foreign Land. The which I question.
Then he told us how we were to be very
civil and obedient on the voyage to those
who were set over us, refraining from cursing,
swearing, gaming, or singing of profane
songs, on pain of immediate and smart chastisement;
and having said this, and the
chaplain having given us his Benediction,
he gat him gone, and we were rid of so
much Rapacious and Luxurious Hypocrisy.
We lay in the yard that night, wrapped in
such extra Garments as some of us were
Fortunate enough to have; and I sobbed
myself to sleep, wishing, I well remember,
that it might never be Day again, but that
my Sorrows might all be closed in by the
Merciful Curtain of Eternal Night.</p>

<p>So on the Monday morning we were
driven down&mdash;a body of Sir Basil Hopwood's
own company of the Trainbands guarding
us&mdash;to Shayler's Stairs, near unto the church
of St. Mary Overy; and there&mdash;we were in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
number about a hundred&mdash;put on board a
Hoy, which straightway, the tide being toward,
bore down the river for Gravesend.</p>

<p>By this time I found that, almost insensibly,
as it were, I had become separated
from my old companions the Blacks, and
that I was more than ever Alone. The
greatest likelihood is, that Authority deemed
it advisable to break up, for good and all,
the Formidable Confederacy they had laid
hold of, and to prevent those Dangerous
Men from ever again making Head together.
But my whole Life was but a kind
of Shifting and uncertain Vision, and I took
little note of the personages with whom I
came in contact, till looking around me, in
a dull listlessness about the Hoy, I found
myself, cheek by jowl, with a motley crew,
seemingly picked up hap-hazard from all the
gaols in England. But 'twas all one to me,
and I did not much care. Such a Stupor of
Misery came over me, that for a time I
almost forgot my good Quaker Friends, and
the lessons they had taught me; that I felt
myself once more drifting into being a dangerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
little brute; and that seeing the
Master of the Hoy, a thirsty-looking man,
lifting a great stone-bottle to his lips, I
longed to serve him as I had served Corporal
Foss with the demijohn of Brandy in
the upper chamber of the Stag o' Tyne.</p>

<p>We landed not at Gravesend, but were
forthwith removed to a bark called <i>The
Humane Hopwood</i>, in compliment, I suppose,
to Sir Basil, and which, after lying three
days in the Downs, put into Deal to complete
her complement of Unfortunate Persons.
And I remember that, before making
Deal, we saw a stranded Brig on the Goodwins,
which was said to be a Leghorner,
very rich with oils and silks; round which
were gathered&mdash;just as you may see obscene
Birds of Prey gathered round a dead carcass,
and picking the Flesh from its bones&mdash;at
least a score of luggers belonging to the
Deal Boatmen. These worthies had knocked
holes in the hull of the wreck, and were
busily hauling out packages and casks into
their craft, coming to blows sometimes with
axes and marlin-spikes as to who should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
have the Biggest Booty. And it was said
on Board that they would not unfrequently
decoy by false signals, or positively haul, a
vessel in distress on to those same Goodwins,&mdash;in
whose fatal depths so many tall
Ships lie Engulfed,&mdash;in order to have the
Plunder of her, which was more profitable
than the Salvage, that being in the long-run
mostly swallowed up by the Crimps and
Longshore Lawyers of Deal and other Ports,
who were wont to buy the Boatmen's rights
at a Ruinous Discount. Salvage Men, indeed,
these Boatmen might well be called;
for when I was young it was their manner
to act with an extreme of Savage Barbarity,
thinking far less of saving Human Life than
of clutching at the waifs and strays of a
Rich Cargo. And then up would sheer a
Custom-House cutter or a Revenue Pink,
the skipper and his crew fierce in their Defence
of the Laws of the Land, the Admiralty
Droits, and their own twentieths; and
from Hard blows with fists and spikes, matters
would often come to the arbitrament of
cutlasses and firearms; so that naval Engagements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of a Miniature kind have often
raged between the Deal Boatmen and the
King's Officers. Surely the world was a Hard
and a Cruel and a Brutal one, when I was
young&mdash;bating the Poor-Laws, which were
more merciful than at present; for now that
I am old the Gazettes are full of the Tender
Valour and Merciful Devotion of the Deal
Boatmen, who, in the most tempestuous
weather, will leave their warm beds, their
wives and bairns, and put off, with the Sea
running mountains high, to rescue Distraught
Vessels and the Precious Lives that
are within them. The Salvage Men of my
time were brave enough, but they were likewise
unconscionable rogues.</p>

<p>The wind proved false to us at Deal, and
we had to wait a weary ten days there.
Captain Handsell was our commander. He
was a man who knew but one course of proceeding.
'Twas always a word and a blow
with him. By the same token the blow
generally came first, and the word that followed
was sure to be a bad one. The Captain
of a Ship, from a Fishing Smack to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Three-Decker, was in those days a cruel and
merciless Despot. 'Twas only the size of
his ship and the number of his Equipage
that decided the question whether he was to
be a Petty Tyrant or a Tremendous One.
His Empire was as undisputed as that of a
Schoolmaster. Who was to gainsay him?
To whom, at Sea, could his victims appeal?
To the Sharks and Grampuses, the Dolphins
and the Bonettas? He was privileged to
beat, to fetter, to starve, to kick, to curse
his Seamen. Even his Passengers trembled
at the sight of this Bashaw of Bluewater;
for he had Irons and Rations of Mouldy
Biscuit for them too, if they offended him;
and many a Beautiful and Haughty Lady
paying full cabin-passage has bowed down
before the wrath of a vulgar Skipper, who,
at home, she would have thought unworthy
to Black her Shoes, and who would be
seething in the revelry of a Tavern in
Rotherhithe, while she would be footing it
in the Saloons of St. James's. Yet for a
little time, at the outset of his voyage, the
Skipper had his superior; the Bashaw had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
a Vizier who was bigger than he. There
was a Terrible Man called the Pilot. He
cared no more for the Captain than the
Archbishop of Canterbury cares for a Charity-Boy.
He gave him a piece of his mind
whenever he chose, and he would have his
own Way, and had it. It was the delight
of the Seamen to see their Tyrant and Bully
degraded for a time under the supreme
authority of the Pilot, who drank the Skipper's
rum; who had the best Beef and
Burgoo at the Skipper's table; who wore, if
he was so minded, the Skipper's tarpaulin;
who used the Skipper's telescope, and
thumbed his charts, and kicked his Cabin-boy,
and swore his oaths, till, but for the
fear of the Trinity House, I think the
Skipper would have been mighty glad to
fling him over the taffrail. But the reign
of this Great Mogul of Lights and Points
and Creeks soon came to an end. A River
Pilot was the lesser evil, a Channel Pilot was
the greater one; but both were got rid of at
last. Then the Skipper was himself again.
He would drink himself blind with Punch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in the forenoon, or cob his cabin-boy to
Death's door after dinner for a frolic. He
could play the very Devil among the Hands,
and they perforce bore with his capricious
cruelty; for there is no running away from
a Ship at Sea. Jack Shark is Gaoler, and
keeps the door tight. There is but one way
out of it, and that is to Mutiny, and hey for
the Black Flag and a Pirate's Free and
Jovial Life!<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> But Mutiny is Hanging,
and Piracy is Hanging, and Gibbeting too;
and how seldom it is that you find Bold
Hearts who have Stuff enough in them to
Run the Great Risk! As on sea, so it is on
land. That Ugly Halter dances before a
man's eyes, and dazes him away from the
Firmest Resolve. For how long will Schoolboys
endure the hideous enormities of a
Gnawbit before they come to the Supreme
Revolt of a Barring-out! And for how
long will a People suffer the mad tyranny of
a Ruler, who outrages their Laws, who
strangles their Liberties, who fleeces and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
squeezes and tramples upon them, before
they take Heart of Grace, and up Pike and
Musket, and down-derry-down with your
Ruler, who is ordinarily the basest of Poltroons,
and runs away in a fright so soon as
the first Goose is bold enough to cry out
that the Capitol <i>shall</i> be saved!</p>


<p>Nothing of this did I think aboard <i>The
Humane Hopwood</i>. I was too young to have
any thought at all, save of rage and anguish
when it pleased Captain Handsell, being in
a cheerful mood, to belabour me, till I was
black and blue, with a rope's end. At the
beginning of the voyage I was put into the
hold, ironed, with the rest of the convicts,
who were only permitted to come on deck
twice a day, morning and evening, for a few
Mouthfuls of Fresh air; who were fed on
the vilest biscuit and the most putrid water,
getting but a scrap of fat pork and a dram
of Rum that was like Fire twice a week, and
who were treated, generally, much like
Negroes on the Middle Passage. But by
and by,&mdash;say after ten days; but I took
little account of Time in this floating Purgatory,&mdash;Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Handsell had me unironed;
and his cabin-boy, a poor weakly little lad,
that could not stand much beating, being
dead of that and a flux, and so thrown overboard
without any more words being said
about it&mdash;(he was but a little Scottish castaway
from Edinburgh, who had been kidnapped
late one night in the Grass Market,
and sold to a Greenock skipper trading in
that line for a hundred pound Scots&mdash;not
above eight pounds of our currency)&mdash;and
there is no Crowner's Quest at sea, I was
promoted to the Vacant Post. I was Strong
enough now, and the Wound in my side
gave me no more pain; and I think I grew
daily stronger and more hardened under the
shower of blows which the Skipper very
liberally dealt out to me; I hardly know
with more plenitude when he was vexed, or
when he was pleased. But I was not the
same bleating little Lamb that the Wolfish
Gnawbit used to torture. No, no; John
Dangerous's apprenticeship had been useful
to him. Even as college-lads graduate in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
their Latin and Greek, so I had graduated
upon braining the Grenadier with the demijohn.
I could take kicks and cuffs, but I
could likewise give them. And so, as this
Roaring Skipper made me a Block to vent
his spite upon, I would struggle with, and
bite, and kick his shins till sometimes we
managed to fall together on the cabin-floor
and tumble about there,&mdash;pull he, pull I,
and a kick together!&mdash;till the Watch would
look down the skylight upon us, grinning,
and chuckle hoarsely that old Belzey, as they
called their commander (being a diminutive
for Beelzebub), and his young Imp were
having a tussle. Thus it came about that
among these unthinking Seamen I grew to
be called Pug (who, I have heard, is the
Lesser Fiend), or Little Brimstone, or young
Pitchladle. And then I, in my Impish way,
would offer to fight them too, resenting
their scurril nicknames, and telling them
that I had but one name, which was Jack
Dangerous.</p>

<p>The oddest thing in the world was that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the Skipper, Ungovernable Brute as he was,
seemed to take a kind of liking for me through
my Resistance to him.</p>

<p>"What a young Tiger-cub it is!" he
would say sometimes, swaying about his
Rope's End, as if undecided whether to hit
me or not. "Lie down, Rawbones! Lie
down, Tearem!"</p>

<p>"You go to hit me again," I would cry,
all hot and flurried; "I'll mark you, I will,
you Tarpaulin Hedgehog!"</p>

<p>Then in a Rage he would make a Rush at
me, and Welt me sorely; but oftener he
would Relent, and opening his Locker would
give me a slice of Sausage, or a white Biscuit,
or a nip of curious Nantz.</p>

<p>At last he gave up maltreating me altogether.
"If you'd been of the same kidney
as Sawney M'Gillicuddy," he said, speaking
of the poor little Scottish lad who Died,
"I'd have made you food for fishes long ago.
'Slid, my younker, but they should 'a had
their meat tender enough, or there's no
vartue in hackled hemp for a lacing! But
you've got a Heart, my lad; and if you're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
not hanged before you're out of your Teens,
you'll show the World that you can Bite as
well as Bark some of these days."</p>

<p>So I became a prime Favourite with
Captain Handsell; and, in the Expansion of
his Liking towards me, he began to give me
instruction in the vocation in which a portion
of my life has since (with no small Distinction,
though I say it that should not)
been passed. Of scientific Navigation this
very Rude and Boorish person knew little,
if any thing; but as a Practical Seaman he
had much skill and experience. Indeed, if
the Hands had not enjoyed a lively Faith
in the solid sea-going Qualities of "Foul-Weather
Bob," as they called him when
they did not choose to give him his demoniacal
appellation, they would have Mutinied,
and sent him, Lashed to a grating, on a
voyage of Discovery at least twice in every
Twenty-Four Hours. For he led them a
most Fearful Life.</p>

<p>I had imparted to him that I was somewhat
of a scholar, and that Captain Night
had taught me something besides stealing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the King's Deer. There was a Bible on
Board, which the Skipper never read,&mdash;and
read, indeed, he was scarcely able to do,&mdash;but
which he turned to the unseemly use,
when he had been over-cruel to his crew, of
swearing them upon it, that they would not
inform against him when they got into port.
For this was an odd medley of a man, and
had his moments of Remorse for evil-doing,
or else of Fear as to what might be the Consequences
when he reached a Land where
some degree of Law and Justice were recognised.
At some times he would propitiate
his crew with donatives of Rum, or even
of Money; but the next day he would have
his Cruelty Fit on again, and use his men
with ten times more Fierceness and Arbitrary
Barbarity. But to this Bible and a
volume of Nautical Tables our Library was
confined; and as he troubled himself very
little about the latter, I was set to read to
him sometimes after dinner from the Good
Book. But he was ever coarse and ungovernable,
and would have no Righteous
Doctrine or Tender Precepts, but only took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
delight when I read to him from the Old
Scriptures the stories of the Jews, their
bloody wars, and how their captains and men
of war slew their Thousands and their Tens
of Thousands in Battle. And with shame I
own that 'twas these Furious Narratives that
I liked also; and with exceeding pleasure
read of Joshua his victories, and Samson his
achievements, and Gideon how he battled,
and Agag how they hewed him in pieces.
Little cockering books I see now put forth,
with pretty decoying pictures, which little
children are bidden to read. Stories from
the Old Testament are dressed up in pretty
sugared language. Oh, you makers of these
little books! oh, you fond mothers who place
them so deftly in your children's hands!
bethink you whether this strong meat is fit
for Babes. An old man, whose life has been
passed in Storms and Stratagems and Violence,
not innocent of blood-spilling, bids you
beware! Let the children read that other
Book, its Sweet and Tender Counsels, its
examples of Mercy and Love to all Mankind.
But if I had a child five or six years old,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
would I let him fill himself with the horrible
chronicles of Lust, and Spoliation, and
Hatred, and Murder, and Revenge? "Why
shouldn't I torture the cat?" asks little
Tommy. "Didn't the man in the Good
Book tie blazing Torches to the foxes' tails?"
And little Tommy has some show of reason
on his side. Let the children grow up; wait
till their stomachs are strong enough to
digest this potent victual. It is hard indeed
for one who has been a Protestant alway to
have to confess that when such indiscreet
reading is placed in children's hands, those
crafty Romish ecclesiastics speak not altogether
foolishly when they tell us that the
mere Word slayeth. But on this point I
am agreed to consult Doctor Dubiety, and to
be bound by his decision.</p>

<p>In so reading to the Skipper every day, I
did not forget to exercise myself in that
other art of Writing, and was in time
serviceable enough to be able to keep, in
something like a rational and legible form
the Log of <i>The Humane Hopwood</i>, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
heretofore had been a kind of cabalistic
Register, full of blots, crosses, half-moons,
and zigzags, like the chalk score of an unlettered
Ale-wife. And the more I read (of
surely the grandest and simplest language
in the world), the more I discovered how
ignorant I was of that essential art of Spelling,
and blushed at the vile manner in which
the Petition I had written to the King of
England was set down. And before we
came to our voyage's end, I had made a
noticeable improvement in the Curious Mystery
of writing Plain English.</p>

<p>One day as the Skipper was taking
Tobacco (for he was a great Smoker), he said
to me, "Jack, do you know what you are,
lad?"</p>

<p>"Your cabin-boy," I answered; "bound
to fetch and carry: hempen wages, and not
much better treated than a dog."</p>

<p>"You lie, you scum," Captain Handsell
answered pleasantly. "You go snacks with
me in the very best, and your beef is boiled
in my own copper. But 'tisn't that I mean.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Do you know how you hail on the World's
books? what the number of your mess in
Life is?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied; "I'm a Transport.
Was to have been hanged; but I wrote out
a Petition, and the Gentlemen in London
gave it to the King, God bless him!"</p>

<p>"Vastly well, mate!" continued the
Captain. "Do you know what a Transport
is?"</p>

<p>"No; something very bad, I suppose;
though I don't see that he can be much
worse off than a cabin-boy that's been cast
for Death, and lain in gaol with a bayonet-wound
he got from a Grenadier,&mdash;let alone
having been among the Blacks, and paid
anigh to Death by Gnawbit,&mdash;when he was
born a Gentleman."</p>

<p>"You lie again. To be a Transport is
worse than aught you've had. Why a cat
in an oven without claws is an Angel of
bliss along of a Transport! You're living
in a land of beans and bacon now, in a land
of milk and honey and new rum. Wait till
you get to Jamaica. The hundred and odd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
vagabonds that I've got aboard will be given
over to the Sheriff at Port Royal, and he'll
sell 'em by auction; and for as long as
they're sent across the herring-pond they'll
be slaves, and worse than slaves, to the
planters; for the black Niggers themselves,
rot 'em! make a mock of a Newgate bird.
Hard work in the blazing sun, scarce enough
to eat to keep body and soul together, the
cat-o'-nine-tails every day, with the cow-hide
for a change; and, when your term's
out, not a Joe in your pocket to help you to
get back to your own country again. That's
the life of a Transport, my hearty. Why,
it's worse cheer than one of my own hands
gets here on shipboard!"</p>

<p>"I think I'd rather be hanged," I said,
with something like a Trembling come over
me at the Picture the Skipper had drawn.</p>

<p>"I should rather think you would; but
such isn't your luck, little Jack Dangerous.
What would you say if I was to tell you
that you ain't a Transport at all?"</p>

<p>I stammered out something, I know not
what, but could make no substantial reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," continued Captain
Handsell, who by this time was getting
somewhat Brisk with his afternoon's Punch.
"Hang it, who's afraid? I like thee, lad.
I'm off my bargain, and don't care a salt
herring if I'm a loser by a few broad pieces
in not sticking to it. I tell thee, Jack,
thou'rt Free, as Free as I am; leastways if
we get to Jamaica without going to Davy
Jones's Locker; for on blue water no man
can say he's Free. No; not the Skipper
even."</p>

<p>And then he told me, to my exceeding
Amazement and Delight, of what an Iniquitous
Transaction I had very nearly been
made the victim. It seems that although
the Pardon granted me after the Petition I
had sent to his Majesty was conditional on
my transporting myself to the Plantations,
further influence had been made for me in
London,&mdash;by whom I knew not then, but I
have since discovered,&mdash;and on the very Day
of the arrival of our condemned crew in
London, an Entire and Free Pardon had
been issued for John Dangerous and lodged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in the hands of Sir Basil Hopwood at his
House in Bishopsgate Street. Along with
this merciful Document there came a letter
from one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries
of State, in which directions were given that
I was to be delivered over to a person who
was my Guardian. And that I was in no
danger of being again given up to the villains
Cadwallader and Talmash, or their Instrument
Gnawbit, was clear, I think, from what
Captain Handsell told me:&mdash;That the Person
bringing the letter&mdash;the Pardon itself being
in the hands of a King's Messenger&mdash;had
the appearance, although dressed in a lay
habit, of being a Foreign Ecclesiastic. The
crafty Extortioner of a Knight and Alderman
makes answer that I had not come with
the other Transports to London, but had
been left sick at Brentford, in the care of an
agent of his there; but he entreats the
Foreign Person to go visit Newgate, where
he had another gang of unhappy persons for
Transportation, and see if I had arrived.
And all this while the wretch knew that I
was safely clapped up in the yard of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Borough Clink. And the Foreign Person
being met at the Old Bailey by one of Hopwood's
creatures, this Thing takes him to
walk on the leads of the Sessions House,
praying him not to enter the gaol, where
many had lately been stricken with the
Distemper, and by and by up comes a Messenger
all hot as it seemed with express
riding,&mdash;though his sweat and dust were all
Forged,&mdash;and says that a gang of Ruffians
have broken up the Cage of Brentford, where,
for greater safety, the Boy Dangerous had
been bestowed; that these Ruffians were
supposed to be the remnant of the Blacks of
Charlwood Chase who had escaped from
capture; and that they had stolen away the
Boy Dangerous, and made clear off with him.
And, indeed, it was a curious circumstance
that Brentford Cage was that day broken
into (the Times were very Lawless), and a
Strange Boy taken out therefrom. But
Hopwood had artfully separated me from
the Blacks who were in Newgate, and placed
me among a stranger mob of riffraff in the
Borough Clink. The Newgate Gang were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in due time taken, not to Gravesend, but
straight away from the Pool to Richmond
in Virginia; whereas I was conveyed to
Gravesend and Deal, and shipped off to
Jamaica in <i>The Humane Hopwood</i>. And what
do you think was the object of this Humane
Scoundrel in thus sequestrating the King's
Pardon and robbing me of my liberty, and
perhaps of the occasion of returning to the
state of a Gentleman, in which I was Born?
'Twas simply to kidnap me, and make a
wretched profit of twenty or thirty pounds,&mdash;the
Commander of his Ship going him
half in the adventure,&mdash;by selling me in the
West Indies, where white boys not being
Transports were then much in demand, to be
brought up as clerks and cash-keepers to the
Planters. Sure there was never such a
Diabolical Plot for so sorry an end; but a
vast number of paltry conspiracies, carried
out with Infernal Cunning and Ingenuity,
had made, in the course of years, Sir Basil
Hopwood rich and mighty, a Knight and
Alderman, Parliament man and ex-Lord
Mayor. To carry out these designs was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
just part of the ordinary calling of a Shipmaster
in those days. 'Twas looked upon
as the simplest matter of business in the
world. To kidnap a child was such an everyday
deed of devilry, that the slightest amount
of pains was deemed sufficing to conceal the
abominable thing. And thus the Foreign
Person saw with dolorous Eyes the convoy
of convicts take their departure from Newgate
to ship on board the Virginian vessel
at St. Katherine's Stairs, while poor little
Jack Dangerous was being smuggled away
from Gravesend to Jamaica.</p>

<p>And to Jamaica I should have gone to be
sold as a Slave, but for the strange occurrence
of the Captain taking a liking to me.
He dared not have kept me among the convicts,
as the Sheriff at Port Royal would
have had a List in Duplicate of their names
sent out by a fast-sailing King's Ship; for
the Government at Home had some faint
Suspicion of the prevailing custom of Kidnapping,
and made some Feeble Attempts
to stop it. But he would have kept me on
board as a ship-boy till the Auction of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Transports was over, and then he would
have coolly sold me, for as much as I would
fetch, to some Merchant of Kingston or
Port Royal, who was used to deal in flesh
and blood, and who, in due course, would
have transferred me, at a profit, to some up-country
planter.</p>

<p>"But that shall never be, Jack my hearty,"
Captain Handsell exclaimed, when, after
many more pipes of Tobacco and rummers
of Punch, he had explained these wonderful
things to me. "I shall lose my half share
in the venture, and shall have to tell a rare
lie to yonder old Skin-a-flea-for-the-hide-and-fat
in London; but what o' that? I tell
thee I won't have the sale of thy flesh and
blood on my conscience. No slave shall
you be, forsooth. I have an aunt at Kingston,
as honest a woman as ever broke biscuit,
although she has got a dash of the tar-brush
on her mug, and she shall take charge
of thee; and if thou were a gentleman born,
I'll be hanged if thou sha'n't be a gentleman
bred."</p>

<p>It would have been more fitted to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
performance of this Honourable and Upright
Action towards one that he had no motive
at all in serving (in Fact, his Interest lay
right the other way), that I should be able
to chronicle a sensible Reformation in my
Commander's bearing and conduct towards
others; but, alas, that I am unable to do;
the truth being that he continued, unto the
very end of our voyage, to be towards the
Hands the same brutal and merciless Tyrant
that he had once, in the days of his Rope's-End
Discipline, been towards me. 'Twas
Punch and Cobbing, Tobacco and Ugly
Words, from the rising of the Sun until the
setting of the same. And for this reason it
is (having seen so many Contradictions in
Human character) that I am never surprised
to hear of a Good Action on the part of a
very Bad Man, or of a Bad Action done by
him who is ordinarily accounted a very Good
one.</p>

<p><i>The Humane Hopwood</i> was a very shy
Sailer,&mdash;being, in truth, as Leaky an old
Tub as ever escaped breaking up for Fire-Wood
at Lumberers' Wharfs,&mdash;and we were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
seven weeks at Sea before we fell in with a
trade-wind, and then setting every Rag we
could hoist, went gaily before that Favourable
breeze, and so cast anchor at Port Royal
in the island of Jamaica.</p>

<p>Captain Handsell was as good as his word.
Not a syllable did he say to the Sheriff of
Kingston about my not being a Transport,
or being, indeed, in the Flesh at all in those
parts; for he argued that the Sheriff might
have some foregatherings with the Knight
and Alderman of Bishopsgate Street by correspondence,
and that the Wealthy Extortioner
might make use of his credit in the
Sugar Islands to do me, some day or another,
an ill turn. But he had me privily on shore
when the Transports had all been assigned
to different task-masters; and in due time
he introduced me to his Aunt, his Brother's
Wife indeed (and I believe he had come out
to the Island with an Old-Bailey Passport;
but Rum and the climate had been too
strong for him, and he had so Died and left
her a Widow).</p>

<p>She was by right and title, then, Mistress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Handsell, with the Christian name of Sarah;
but among the coloured people of Kingston
she went by the name of Maum Buckey,
and, among her more immediate intimates,
as "Yaller Sally." And, although she
passed for being very Wealthy, I declare
that she was nothing but a Washerwoman.
This Washing Trade of hers, however, which
she carried on for the King and Merchants'
ships that were in Harbour, and for nearly
all the rich Merchants and Traders of Kingston,
brought Maum Buckey in a very
pretty penny; and not only was her tub
commerce a brisk ready-money business, but
she had two flourishing plantations&mdash;one
for the growing of Coffee, and the other of
Sugar&mdash;near the town of Savannah de la
Mar. Moreover, she had a distillery of Rum
and Arrack in Kingston itself, and everybody
agreed that she must be very well to
do in the world. She was an immensely fat
old Mulotter woman, on the wrong side of
Fifty when I knew her, and her Mother had
been a slave that had been the Favourite
Housekeeper to the English Governor, who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
dying, left her her Freedom, and enough
Money to carry on that Trade of cleansing
clothes which her Daughter afterwards made
so profitable.</p>

<p>Maum Buckey and I soon became very
good friends. She was proud of her
relationship with a white Englishman&mdash;"a
right go-down Buckra" as she called him&mdash;who
commanded a ship, and besides recommended
her to other gentlemen in his way
for a Washerwoman; and although she took
care to inform me, before we had been
twenty-four hours acquainted, that her Husband,
Sam Handsell, has been a sad Rascal,
who would have drunk all her Money away,
had he not Timeously drunk himself to death,
she made me the friendliest welcome, and
promised that she would do all she could for
me, "the little piccaninny buckra," who was
set down by Mr. Handsell as being the son
of an old Shipmate of his that had met with
misfortunes. After a six weeks' stay in the
island, and <i>The Humane Hopwood</i> getting
Freight in the way of Sugar, Captain Handsell
bade me good by, and set sail with a fair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
wind for Bristol, England. I never set
Eyes upon him again. You see, my Friends,
that this is no cunningly-spun Romance, in
which a character disappears for a Season,
and turns up again, as pat as you please,
at the end of the Fourth Volume; but
a plain Narrative of Facts, in which the
Personages introduced must needs Come and
Go precisely as they Came and Went to me
in Real Life. I have often wished, when I
had Power and Riches, to meet with and show
my Gratitude to the rough old Sea-Porpoise
that used to Rope's-End me so, and was so
tearing a Tyrant to his Hands, and yet in
a mere fit of kind-heartedness played the
Honest Man to me, when All Things seemed
against me, and rescued John Dangerous
from a Foul and Wicked Trap.</p>

<p>Maum Buckey had a great rambling
house&mdash;it had but one Storey, with a Piazza
running round, but a huge number of Rooms
and Yards&mdash;in the suburbs of Kingston.
There did I take up my abode. She had at
least twenty Negro and Mulotter Women
and Girls that worked for her at the Washing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and at Starching and Ironing, for the
Mill was always going with her. 'Twas wash,
wash, wash, and wring, wring, wring, and
scrub, scrub, scrub, all day and all night too,
when the harbour was full of ships. Not
that she ever touched Soapsuds or Flat-iron
or Goffering-stick herself. She was vastly
too much of a Fine Lady for that, and would
loll about in a great chair,&mdash;one Negro child
fanning her with a great Palmetto, and another
tickling the soles of her feet,&mdash;sipping
her Sangaree as daintily as you please. She
was the most ignorant old creature that ever
was known, could neither read nor write,
and made a sad jumble of the King's English
when she spoke; yet, by mere natural
quickness and rule-of-thumb, she could calculate
to a Joe how much a Shipmaster's
Washing-Bill came to. And when she had
settled that according to her Scale of Charges,
which were of the most Exorbitant Kind,
she would Grin and say, "He dam ship,
good consignee;" or, "He dam ship, dam
rich owner; stick him on 'nother dam fi'
poun' English, my chile;" and for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
curious reason or another, 'twas seldom that
a shipmaster cared to quarrel with Maum
Buckey's Washing-Bills. She, being so unlettered,
had been compelled to engage all
manner of Whites who could write and read&mdash;now
Transports, now Free&mdash;to keep her
accounts, and draw her necessary writings;
but it was hard to tell which were the
greatest Rogues, the Convicts whose term
was out, or the Free Gentlemen who had
come out without a pair of iron garters to
their hose. In those days all our plantations,
and Jamaica most notably, were full of the
very Scum and Riffraff of our English towns.
'Twas as though you had let Fleet Ditch,
dead dogs and all, loose on a West-India
Island. That Ragged Regiment which Falstaff
in the Play would not march through
Coventry with were at free quarters in
Jamaica, leave alone the regular garrison of
King's Troops, of which the private men
were mostly pickpockets, poachers, and runaway
serving-men, who had enlisted to save
themselves from a merry-go-round at Rope
Fair; and the officers the worst and most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
abandoned Gentlemen that ever wore his
Majesty's cockade, and gave themselves airs
because they had three-quarters of a yard of
black ribbon crinked up in their hats.
Captain This, who had been kicked out of a
Charing-Cross coffee-house for pocketing a
Punch-ladle while the drawer was not looking;
Lieutenant That, who had been caned
on the Mall for cheating at cards; and
Ensign T'other, who had been my lord's
valet, and married his Madam for enough
cash to buy a pair of colours withal&mdash;Military
gentlemen of this feather used to
serve in the West Indies in those days, and
swagger about Kingston as proud as peacocks,
when every one of them had done
that at home they should be cashiered for.
Maum Buckey would not have to do with
these light-come-light-go gallants. "Me
wash for Gem'n Ship-Cap'n, Gem'n Marchants,
Gem'n Keep-store," she would observe;
"me not wash for dam Soger-officer."</p>

<p>Her Sugar Plantation was in charge of
a shrewd North-countryman, against whom,
save that he was a runaway bankrupt from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Hull in England, there was nothing to say.
Her Coffee Estate was managed by an Irishman
that had married, as he thought, a great
Fortune, but found the day after his wedding
that she but a fortune-hunter like himself,
and had at least three husbands living
in divers parts of the world. And finally,
the Distillery had for overseer one, an Englishman,
that had been a Horse Couper, and
a runner for the Crimps at Wapping, and a
supercargo that was not too honest,&mdash;albeit
he had to keep his accounts pretty square
with Maum Buckey, than whom there never
was a woman who had a keener Eye for
business or a finer Scent for a Rogue.</p>

<p>She made me her Bookkeeper for the
Washing Department. 'Twas not a very
dignified Employment for one that had been
a young Gentleman, but 'twas vastly better
than the Fate of one who, but for a mere
Accident, might have been a young Slave.
So I kept Maum Buckey's Books, teaching
myself how to do so featly from a Ready
Reckoner and Accomptant's Assistant (Mr.
Cocker's), which I bought at a Bookstore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in Kingston. The work was pretty hard,
and the old Dame of the Tub kept me
tightly enough at it; but when the work
was over she was very kind to me, and we
had the very best of living: ducks and
geese and turkeys and pork (of which the
Mulotter women are inordinately fond,
although I never could reconcile to myself
how their stomachs, in so hot a climate,
could endure so Luscious a Food); fish of
the primest from the Harbour of Port Royal,
lobsters and crabs and turtle (which last is as
cheap as Tripe with us, and so plentiful, that
the Niggers will sometimes disdain to eat
it, though 'tis excellent served as soup in
the creature's own shell, and a most digestible
Viand); to say nothing of bananas,
shaddock, mango, plantains, and the many
delicious fruits and vegetables of that Fertile
Colony; where, if the land-breeze in the
morning did not half choke you with harsh
dust, and the sea-breeze in the afternoon
pierce you to the marrow with deadly chills,
and if one could abstain from surfeits of
fruits and over-drinking of the too abundant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
ardent spirits of the country, a man might
live a very jovial kind of life. However, I
was young and healthy, and, though never
a shirker of my glass in after-days, prudently
moderate in my Potations. During four
years that I passed in the Island of Jamaica
(one of the brightest jewels in the British
Crown, and as Loyal, I delight to say, as I
am myself), I don't think I had the Yellow
Fever more than three times, and at last
grew as tough as leather, and could say Bo
to a land-crab (how many a White Man's
carcass have those crabs picked clean at the
Palisadoes!), as though I feared him no
more than a Green Goose.</p>

<p>It may be fitting here that I should say
something about that Abominable Curse of
Negro Slavery, which was then so Familiar
and Unquestioned a Thing in all our Colonies,
that its innate and Detestable Wickedness
was scarcely taken into account in men's
minds. Speaking only by the Card, and of
that which I saw with my own eyes, I don't
think that Maum Buckey was any crueller
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'han'">than</ins> other slave-owners of her class: for 'tis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
well known that the Mulotter women are far
more severe task-mistresses than the Whites.
But, Lord! Whites and coloured people, who
in the West Indies are permitted, when free,
to own their fellow-creatures who are only a
shade darker in colour than they, left little
to choose betwixt on the score of cruelty.
When I tell you that I have seen Slave
Women and Girls chained to the washing-tub,
their naked bodies all one gore of blood
from the lashes of the whip; that on the
public wharf at Kingston I have seen a Negro
man drawn up by his hands to a crane
used for lifting merchandise, while his toes,
that barely touched the ground, were ballasted
with a thirty-pound weight, and, in
that Trim, beaten with the Raw Hide or
with Tamarind-Bushes till you could lay
your two fingers in the furrows made by the
whip (with which expert Scourgineers boast
they can lay deep ruts in a Deal Board), or
else I have seen the poor Miserable Wretch
the next day lying on his face on the Beach,
and a Comrade taking the prickles of the
Tamarind-Stubs, which are tempered in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Fire, and far worse than English Thornbushes,
out of his back;&mdash;you may imagine
that 'twas no milk-and-water Regimen that
the slaves in the West Indies had to undergo
at the hands of their Hard masters and mistresses.
Also, I have known slaves taken to
the Sick-House, or Hospital, so dreadfully
mangled with unmerciful correction as for
their wounds to be one mass of putrefaction,
and they shortly do give up the Ghost;
while, at other times, I have seen unfortunate
creatures that had been so lacerated,
both back and front, as to be obliged to crawl
about on All Fours. Likewise have I seen
Negro men, Negro women, yea, and Negro
children, with iron collars and prongs about
their necks; with logs riveted to their legs,
with their Ears torn off, their Nostrils slit,
their Cheeks branded, and otherwise most
frightfully Mutilated. Item, I have known
at the dinner-table of a Planter of wealth
and repute, the Jumper, or Public Flogger,
to come in and ask if Master and Missee had
any commands for him; and, by the order of
the Lady of the House, take out two Decent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Women that had been waiting at the table,
and give them fifty lashes apiece on the public
parade, every stroke drawing Blood and
bringing Flesh with it, and they, when all
was over, embracing and thanking him for
their Punishment, as was the custom of the
Colony.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Item, within my own knowledge
have I been made familiar with many acts of
the Deepest Barbarity. Mistresses, for Jealousy
or Caprice, pouring boiling-water or
hot melted Sealing-Wax on their slave girls'
flesh after they had suffered the worst Tortures
of the whip; and white Ladies of
Education rubbing Cayenne-pepper into the
eyes of Negroes who had offended them, or
singeing the tenderest parts of their limbs
with sticks of fire. And of one horrid instance
have I heard of Malignant and Hellish
revenge in Two Ladies who were Sisters (and
bred at a Fine Boarding-School in England),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
who, having a spite against a yellow woman
that attended on them, did tie her hands and
feet, and so beat her nearly to death with the
heels of their slippers; and not satisfied with
that, or with laving her gashed body with
Vinegar and Chillies, did send for a Negro
man, and bid him, under threats of punishment,
strike out two of the Victim's teeth
with a punch, which, to the shame of Human
Womanhood, was done.</p>


<p>But enough of these Horrors:&mdash;not the
worst that I have seen, though, in the course
of my Adventures; only I will not further
sicken you with the Recital of the Sufferings
inflicted on the Wretched Creatures by
Ladies and Gentlemen, who had had the
first breeding, and went to Church every
Sunday. I have merely set down these
dreadful things to work out the theory of
my Belief, that the World is growing Milder
and more Merciful every day; and that the
Barbarities which were once openly practised
in the broad sunshine, and without e'er a one
lifting finger or wagging tongue against
them, are becoming rarer and rarer, and will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
soon be Impossible of Commission. The
unspeakable Miseries of the Middle Passage
(of which I have been an eye-witness) exist
no more; really Humane and Charitable
Gentlemen, not such False Rogues and Kidnappers
as your Hopwoods, are bestirring
themselves in Parliament and elsewhere to
better the Dolorous Condition of the Negro;
and although it may be a Decree of Providence
that the children of Ham are to continue
always slaves and servants to their
white brethren, I see every day that men's
hearts are being more and more benevolently
turned towards them, and that laws, ere long,
will be made to forbid their being treated
worse than the beasts that perish.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE SECOND.</h2>

<h3>OF OTHER MY ADVENTURES UNTIL MY COMING TO
BE A MAN.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Thus</span> in a sultry colony, among Black Negroes
and their cruel Task-masters, and I the
clerk to a Mulotter Washerwoman, did I
come to be full sixteen years of age, and a
stalwart Lad of my inches. But for that
Fate, which from the first irrevocably decreed
that mine was to be a Roving Life, almost
to its end, I might have continued in the
employ of Maum Buckey until Manhood
overtook me. The Dame was not unfavourable
towards me; and, without vanity, may
I say that, had I waited my occasion, 'tis
not unlikely but that I might have married
her, and become the possessor of her plump
Money-Bags, full of Moidores, pilar Dollars,
and pieces of Eight. Happily I was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
permitted so to disparage my lineage, and
put a coffee-coloured blot on my escutcheon.
No, my Lilias is no Mulotter Quartercaste.
'Twas my roving propensity that made me
set but little store by the sugar-eyes and
Molasses-speech which Madam Soapsuds
was not loth to bestow on me, a tall and
likely Lad. I valued her sweetness just as
though it had been so much cane-trash.
With much impatience I had waited for the
coming back of my friendly skipper, that he
might advise me as to my future career.
But, as I have already warned the Reader,
it was fated that I was to see that kindly
shipmaster no more. Once, indeed, the old
ship came into Port Royal, and right eagerly
did I take boat and board her. But her
name had been changed from <i>The Humane
Hopwood</i> to <i>The Protestant Pledge</i>. She was
in the Guinea trade now, and brought Negroes,
poor souls! to slave in our Plantations.
The Mariner that was her commander
had but dismal news to tell me of my friendly
Handsell. He, returning to the old country,
had it seems a Mighty Quarrel with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Patron&mdash;and my Patron too, forsooth!&mdash;Villain
Hopwood. Whether he had reproached
him with his treachery to me or
not, I know not; but it is certain that both
parted full of Wrath and High Disdain, and
each swearing to be the Ruin of the other.
But Gold had, as it has always in a Mammon-ridden
world, the longest, strongest
pull. Devil Hopwood found it easy to get
the better of a poor unlettered tarpaulin,
that knew well enough the way into a Wapping
Alehouse, but quite lost himself in
threading the mazes of a great man's Antechamber.
'Tis inconceivable how much dirty
work there was done in my young days between
Corinthian columns and over Turkey
carpets, and under ceilings painted by Verrio
and Laguerre. Sir Basil, I believe, went to
a great man, and puts a hundred guineas
into the hands of his Gentleman&mdash;by the
which I mean his Menial Servant, save that
he wore no Livery; but there's many a Base
wretch hath his soul in plush, and the Devil's
aigulets on his heart. How much out of the
Hundred my Lord took, and how much his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Gentleman kept, it serves not to inquire.
They struck a Bargain, and short was the
Time before Ruin came swooping down on
Captain Handsell. He had gone into the
Channel trade; and they must needs have
him exchequered for smuggling brandies and
lace from St. Malo's. Quick on this follows
a criminal Indictment, from which, as a Fool,
he flies; for he might at least have threatened
to say damaging things of Brute Basil
in the dock, and have made terms with him
before trial came on. And then he must
needs take command of a miserable lugger
that fetched and carried between Deal and
Dunquerque&mdash;the old, old, sorry tinpot business
of kegs of strong waters, and worse
contraband in the guise of Jacobite despatches.
To think of brave men's lives being
risked in these twopenny errands, and a
heart of Oak brought to the gallows, that
clowns may get drunk the cheaper, or traitors&mdash;for
your Jacobite conspirators were
but handy-dandy Judases, now to King
James and now to King George&mdash;exchange
their rubbishing ciphers the easier! It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
drives me wild to think of these pinchbeck
enterprises. If a Man's tastes lead him towards
the Open, the Bold, and the Free, e'en
let him ship himself off to a far climate, the
hotter the better, where Prizes are rich, and
the King's writ in Assault and Battery runneth
not,&mdash;nor for a great many other things
ayont Assault and Battery,&mdash;and where, up
a snug creek, of which he knows the pilotage
well, he may give a good account of a
King's ship when he finds her. He who
does any thing contrair to English law within
five hundred leagues of an English lawyer
or an English law-court is a very Ass and
Dolt. Fees and costs will have their cravings;
and from the process-server to the
Hangman all will have their due. Give me
an offing, where there is no law but that of
the strong hand and the bold Heart. Any
sharks but land-sharks for John Dangerous.
I never see a parchment-visaged, fee-clutching
limb of the law but I long to beat him,
and, if I had him on blue water, to trice him
up higher than ever he went before. But
for a keg of brandy! But for a packet of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
treason-papers! Shame! 'tis base, 'tis
idiotic. And this did the unlucky Handsell
find to his cost. I believe he was slain in a
midnight affray with some Riding Officers of
the Customs close unto Deal, about two years
after his going into a trade that was as mean
as it was perilous.</div>

<p>So no more Hope for me from that quarter.
The skipper of <i>The Protestant Pledge</i>
would have retained me on board for a
Carouse; but I had too much care for my
Head and my Liver for such pranks, and
went back, as dolefully as might be, to keep
Maum Buckey's washing-books. I chafed
at the thought that I could do no more. I
told her the grim news I had heard of her
brother-in-law, whereat she wept somewhat;
for where Whites were concerned she was not
a hard-hearted woman. But she cheered up
speedily, saying that Sam had come to as
sorry an end, and that she supposed there
was but one way with the Handsells, Rum
and Riot being generally their Ruin.</p>

<p>As it is one of the failings of youth not
to know when it is well off, and to grow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
A-weary even of continued prosperity, I admit
that the life I led palled upon me, and
that I longed to change it. But it was not,
all things considered, so very unpleasant a
one. True, the employment was a sorry one,
and utterly beneath the dignity of a Gentleman,
such as bearing fardels in the streets
or unloading casks and bales at the wharf,
for instance. But it is in man's nature never
to be satisfied, and when he is well to long
to be better, and so, by force of striving, to
tumble into a Hole, where indeed he is at
the Best, for he is Dead. At this distance of
time, though I have many comforts around
me,&mdash;Worldly Goods, a Reputable name, my
Child, and her Husband,&mdash;I still look back
on my old life in Jamaica, and confess that
Providence dealt very mercifully with me in
those bygone days. For I had enough to
eat and to drink, and a Mistress who, although
Passionate and Quarrelsome enough
by times, was not unkind. If she would
swear, she would also tender gentle Language
upon occasion; and if she would throw
things, she was not backward in giving one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a dollar to heal one's pate. An odd life it
was, truly. There was very little of that
magnificence about the town of Port Royal
in my days which I have heard the Creoles
to boast about. It may have been handsome
enough in the Spaniard's Reign, or in King
Charles the Second's; but I have heard that
its most comely parts had been swallowed up
by an Earthquake, and, when I remember it,
the Main thoroughfare was like nothing half
so much as the Fag End of Kent Street in
the Borough, where the Broom-men live.
As for public scavengers&mdash;humane at least&mdash;there
were none; for that salutary practice
of putting rebellious Blacks into chain-gangs,
and making them sweep the streets,&mdash;which
might be well done in London with Pickpockets
and the like trash, to their souls'
health and the benefit of the Body politic,&mdash;did
not then obtain. The only way of clearing
the offal was by the obscene birds that
flew down from the hills; Messieurs the
landcrabs, who were assuredly the best scavengers
of all, not stirring beyond the Palisadoes.
Some things were very cheap, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
others inordinately dear. Veal was at a prodigious
price; and 'twas a common saying,
that you could buy Four children in England
cheaper than you could one calf in Jamaica.
But for the products and dishes of the colony,
which I have elsewhere hinted at, all was as
low-priced as it was abundant. What droll
names did they give, too, unto their fish and
flesh and fowl! How often have you in
England heard of Crampos, Bonettas, Ringrays,
Albacoras, and Sea-adders, among fish;
of Noddies and Boobies and Pitternells and
Sheerwaters among birds? And Calialou
Soup, and Pepperpot to break your Fast
withal in the morning, and make you feel,
ere you get accustomed to that Fiery victual,
like a Salamander for some hours afterwards!</p>

<p>Now and then also, with some other young
white folks with whom I had stricken up
acquaintance,&mdash;clerks, storekeepers, and the
like,&mdash;would we seek out the dusky beauties
of the town in their own quarters, and shake
a leg at their Dignity Routs, Blackamoor
Drums, and Pumpkin-Faced Assemblies, or
by what other name the poor Black wretches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
might choose to call their uproarious merrymakings.
There, in some shed, all hustled
together as a Moorfields Sweetener does luck
in a bag, would be a mob of men and women
Negroes, all dressed in their bravest finery,
although little of it was to be seen either on
their Backs or their Feet; the Head being
the part of their Bodies which they chiefly
delight to ornament. Such ribbons and
owches, such gay-coloured rags and blazing
tatters, would they assume, and to the Trips
and Rounds played to them by some Varlet
of a black fiddler, with his hat at a prodigious
cock, and mounted on a Tub, like unto the
sign of the Indian Bacchus at the Tobacconist's,
would they dance and stamp and
foot it merrily&mdash;with plenty of fruit, salt
fish, pork, roasted plantain, and so forth, to
regale themselves withal, not forgetting
punch and sangaree&mdash;quite forgetful, poor
mercurial wretches, for the time being of
Fetters and the Scourge and the Driver that
would hurry them to their dire labour the
morrow morn. Surely there never did exist
so volatile, light-spirited, feather-brained a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
race as these same Negro Blacks. They will
whistle and crack nuts, ay and dance and
sing to the music of the Fiddle or the Banjar
an hour after the skin has been half
flayed off their backs. They seem to bear
no particular Malice to their Tormentors, so
long as their weekly rations of plantain,
yam, or salt fish, be not denied them, and
that they have Osnaburgs enow to make
them shirts and petticoats to cover themselves.
Give them but these, and their
dance at Christmas time, with a kind word
thrown to them now and again, just as
you would fling a marrow-bone to a dog,
and they will get along well enough in
slavery, almost grinning at its Horrors and
making light of its unutterable Woes. I
never saw so droll a people in my life. Nor
is it the less astonishing thing about them
that, beneath all this seeming lightheartedness
and jollity, there often lies smouldering
a Fire of the Fiercest passion and blackest
revenge. The dark-skinned fellow who may
be flapping the flies away from you in the
morning, and bearing your kicks and cuffs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
as though they were so many cates and
caresses, may, in the evening, make one in
a circle of Heathen monsters joined together
to listen to the Devilish Incantations of the
Obeah man,&mdash;to mingle in ceremonies most
hideous and abominable, and of which perhaps
that of swearing eternal Hatred to the
White Race over a calabash that is made out
of the skull of a new-born Babe, and filled
with Dirt, Rum, and Blood mixed together,
is perchance the least horrid. And yet I
don't think the unhappy creatures are by
nature either treacherous, malicious, or cruel.
'Tis only when the fit seizes them. Like
the Elephants, the idea suddenly comes over
them that they are wronged&mdash;that 'tis the
White Man who has wrought them all these
evils, and that they are bound to Trample him
to bleeding mud without more ado. But 'tis
all done in a capricious cobweb-headed manner;
and on the morrow they are as quiet
and good-tempered as may be. Then, just
as suddenly, will come over them a fit of
despondency, or dark, dull, brooding Melancholy.
If they are at sea, they will cast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
themselves into the waves and swim right
toward the sharks, whose jaws are yawning to
devour them. If they are on dry land, they
will, for days together, refuse all food, or
worse still, go dirt-eating, stuffing themselves
with clay till they have the <i>mal
d'estomac</i>, and so die: this <i>mal</i>, of which our
English stomach-ache gives no valid translation
(which must prove my excuse for placing
here a foreign word), being, with the Yaws,
their most frequent and fatal complaint. Of
a less perplexing nature also are their fits of
the Sulks, when, for more than a week at a
time, they will remain wholly mute and intractably
obstinate, folding their arms or
squatting on their hams, and refusing either
to move or speak, whatsoever threats may
be uttered or enforced against them, and
setting no more store by the deep furrowing
cuts of the Cowhide whip (that will make
marks in a deal board, if well laid on, the
which I have often seen) than by the buzzings
of a Shambles Fly. They had many
ways of treating these fits of the sulks, in
my time all of them cruel, and none of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
successful. One was, to set the poor wretches
in the stocks, or the bilboes, rubbing chillies
into the eyes to keep them from going to
sleep. Another was a dose of the Fire-cane,
as it was called, which was just a long
paddle, or slender oar, pierced with holes at
the broadest part, with the which the patient
being belaboured, a blister on the fish rose
to each hole of the Paddle. A curious
method, and one much followed; but the
Negroes sulked all the more for it. There
was a Dutch woman from Surinam, who had
brought with her from that plantation of
the Hollanders that highly Ingenious Mode
of Torment known as the "Spanso Bocko."<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
The manner of it was this. You took your
Negro and tied him wrists and ankles, so
bending him into a neat curve. Then, if
his spine did not crack the while, you thrust
a stake between his legs, and having thus
comfortably Trussed him, pullet fashion, you
laid him on the ground one side upwards,
and at your leisure scarified him from one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
cheek to one heel with any instrument of
Torture that came handy. Then he (or she,
it did not at all matter in the Dutchwoman's
esteem), being one gore of welts and gashes,
was thought to be Done enough on one side,
and consequently required Doing t'other.
So one that stood by to help just took
hold of the stake and turned the Human
Pullet over, and then he was so thoroughly
basted as sometimes to be Done a little too
much, often dying on the spot from that
Rib wasting. Oh, it was rare sport! I
wonder whereabouts in the nethermost Hell
the cunning Dutchman is now who first devised
this torment; also the Dutchwoman
who practised it? I can fancy Signor Beelzebub
and his Imps taking a keen delight in
<i>their</i> application of the Spanso Bocko. The
which I never knew it cure a Negro of the
sulks. They would force back their tongues
into their gullets while the torment was
going on, determined not so much as to
utter a moan, and, having a peculiar Art
that way, brought by them from <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ther'">their</ins> own
country, would often contrive to suffocate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
themselves and Expire. Their own country!
That is what one of the miserable beings said
when, being threatened with torment of a
peculiar, outrageous nature, he flung himself
into a cauldron of boiling sugar, and
was scalded to death on the instant. Let
me not omit to mention while I am on this
chapter of Brutality&mdash;wreaked by Christian
men upon poor Heathen savages, for many
of them were not many weeks from Guinea
and Old Calabar, where they had been worshiping
Mumbo Jumbo, and making war upon
one another in their own Pagan fashion&mdash;that
I have known Planters even more refined
in their cruelty. They would make
their slaves drink salt water, and then set
them out in the hot sun tied to the outside
posts of the Piazza. The end of that was, that
they went Raving Mad, gnawing their
Tongues and poor blubberous Lips to
pieces<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> before they died. Another genius,
who was a proficient in his Humanities, and
quite of a classic frame of mind in his cruelties,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
bethought himself of a mode of Torture
much practised among the Ancient Persians,
and so must needs smear the body of an unhappy
Negro all over with molasses. Then,
binding him fast to a stake in the open, the
flies and mosquitoes got at him,&mdash;for he was
kept there from one morning until the next,&mdash;and
he presently gave up the Ghost. But
nothing that I ever saw or heard of during
the time of my living in the Western Indies,
could equal the Romantic Torture, not so
much invented as imported, by a Gentleman
Merchant who had lived among the islands
of the Grecian Archipelago, and whose jocose
humour it was to imprison his women slaves
in loose garments of leather, very tightly
secured, however, at the wrists, neck, and
ankles. In the same garments, before
fastening round the limbs of the victim, one
or more Infuriated cats were introduced; the
which ferocious animals, playfully disporting
themselves in their attempt to find a point
of egress, would so up and tear, and mangle,
and lacerate, with their Terrible claws, the
flesh of the sufferers, that not all the Brine-washing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
or pepper-pod-rubbing in the world,
afterwards humanely resorted to on their release
from their leathern sepulchre, would
save them from mortification. There was a
completeness and gusto about this Performance
that always made me think my Gentleman
Merchant from the Greek Islands a
very Great Mind. The mere vulgar imitations
of his Process which, in times more
Modern, I have heard of&mdash;such as taking an
angry cat by the tail and drawing its claws
all abroad down the back of a Negro strapped
on to a plank, so making a map of all
the rivers in Tartarus from his neck to his
loins&mdash;are, in my holding, beneath contempt.
There is positive Genius in that idea of
shutting up the cats in a hide-bound prison,
and so letting them work their own wills on
the inner walls; and I hope my Gentleman
Merchant has as warm a niche in Signor
Beelzebub's Temple of Fame, as the Great
Dutch Philosopher who first dreamt of the
Spanso Bocko.</p>


<p>Before I left the island of Jamaica, there
befell me an adventure which I may briefly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
narrate. It being the sickly season and
very few ships in port, Maum Buckey's
business was somewhat at a stand-still, and
with little difficulty I obtained from her a
fortnight's holiday. I might have spent it
with no small pleasure, and even profit, at
one of her up-country plantations, or at the
Estate of some other Planter; for I had
friends and to spare among the white Overseers
and Bookkeepers; and although the
Gentry&mdash;that is to say, the Enriched Adventurers,
who deemed themselves such&mdash;were
of course too High and Mighty to
associate with one of my Mean Station, I
was at no loss for companions among those
of my own degree. So bent upon a frolic,
and being by this time a good Rider and a
capital shot, I joined a band of wild young
Slips like myself, to go up the country hunting
the miserable Negroes that had Marooned,
as it was called. These Maroons were runaway
slaves who had bid a sudden good-by
to bolts and shackles, whips and rods, and
shown their Tyrants a clean pair of heels,
finding their covert in the dense jungles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that covered the mountain slopes, where they
lived on the wild animals and birds they
could shoot or snare, and sometimes making
descents to the nearest plantations, thence
to carry off cattle, ponies, or pigs, or whatever
else they could lay their felonious
hands upon. These were the Blacks again,
you will say, with a vengeance, and at many
Thousand Miles' distance from Charlwood
Chase: but those poor varlets of Deerstealers
in England never dreamt of taking Human
Life, save when defending their own, in a
fair stand-up Fight; whereas the Maroons
had no such scruples, and spared neither
age, nor sex, nor Degree&mdash;that had a white
skin&mdash;in their bloodthirsty frenzy. The
Savage Indians in the American plantations,
who will swoop down on some peaceful
English settlement, slaying, scalping, and
Burning up men, women, and children,&mdash;with
other Horrors and Outrages not to be
described in decent terms,&mdash;are just on a
par with these black Maroons. Now and
again would be found among them some
Household Runaways, or Field Hands born<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
into slavery on the Plantations,&mdash;and these
were most useful in acting as spies or scouts;
but as a rule the Head Men and Boldest
Villains among the Maroons were Savage
Negroes, just fresh from Africa, on whom
the bonds of servitude had sate but for a
short time, and who in the jungle were as
much at Home as though they were in their
native wilds again. Of great stature, of
prodigious strength, amazing Agility, and
astounding natural cunning, these creatures
were as ferocious as Wild Baboons that had
lived among civilized mankind just long
enough to learn the Art of firing off a Gun
and wielding a cutlass, instead of brandishing
a Tree-branch or heaving a Cocoa-nut.
They were without Pity; they were without
knowledge that theirs was a cut-throat,
nay, a cannibal trade. The white man had
made war on them, and torn them from
their Homes, where they were happy enough
in their Dirt and Grease, their War-paint,
and their idolatrous worship of Obeah and
Bungey. 'Twas these Men-monsters that
we went to hunt. The Planters themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
were somewhat chary of dealing with them;
for the cruelty which the Maroons inflicted
on those who fell into their power were
Awful alone to contemplate, much more so
to Endure; but they were glad enough
when any gang of young Desperadoes of the
meaner white sort&mdash;which, speaking not for
myself, I am inclined to believe the Meanest
and most Despicable of any sort or condition
of Humanity&mdash;would volunteer to go
on a Maroon Hunt. We were to have a
Handsome Recompense, whether our enterprise
succeeded or failed; but were likewise
stimulated to increased exertion by the covenanted
promise of so many dollars&mdash;I
forget how many now&mdash;for every head of a
Maroon that we brought at our saddlebows
to the place of Rendezvous. And so we
started one summer morning, some twenty
strong, all young, valiant, and not overscrupulous,
armed, I need scarcely say, to
the teeth, and mounted on the rough but
fleet ponies of the country.</p>

<p>A train of Negroes on whom we could
Depend&mdash;that is, by the strict application<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of the law of Fear, not Kindness, and who
stood in such Terror of us, and of our ever-ready
Thongs, Halters, Pistols, and Cutlasses,
as scarcely to dare call their souls
their own&mdash;followed us with Sumpter mules
well laden with provisions, kegs of drink,
both of water and ardent, and additional
ammunition. I was full of glee at the prospects
of this Foray, vowed that it was a
hundred times pleasanter than making out
Maum Buckey's washing-books, and hearing
her scold her laundry-wenches; and longed
to prove to my companions that the Prowess
I had shown at twelve&mdash;ay, and before that
age, when I brained the Grenadier with the
Demijohn&mdash;had not degenerated now that I
was turned sixteen, and far away from my
own country. So we rode and rode, who
but we, and dined gaily under spreading
trees, boasting of the brave deeds we would
do when we had tracked the black Marooning
vagabonds to their lair. At which
those Negro servants upon whom we could
depend grinned from ear to ear, and told us
in their lingo that they "oped we would soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Dam black negar tief out, and burn his
Fader like canebrake." "'Tis strange," I
thought, "that these creatures have not
more compassion for their fellows whom we
are hunting." To be sure, they were mostly
of the Household breed, between whom and
the fresh-imported Negroes held to field-service
there is little sympathy. It escaped
me to tell you that we had with us yet
more powerful and Trustworthy auxiliaries
than either our arms, our Horses, or our
servants; being none other than nine couples
of ferocious Bloodhounds, of a breed now
extinct in Jamaica, and to be found only at
this present moment, I believe, in the island
of Cuba. These animals, which were of a
terrible Ferocity and exquisitely keen scent,
were kept specially for the purpose of hunting
Maroons,&mdash;such are the Engines which
Tyrannical Slavery is compelled to have recourse
to,&mdash;and were purposely deprived of
food beyond that necessary for their bare
sustenance, that they might more fully relish
the Recompense that awaited them when
they had hunted down their prey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Gaily we went on our Road rejoicing,
now by mere bridle-paths, and now plunging
our hardy little steeds right through the
bristling underwood, when there burst upon
us one of those terrible Tornadoes, or Tempests
of wind and rain, so common in the
Western Indies. The water came down in
great solid sheets, drenching us to the skin
in a moment; the sky was lit up for hundreds
of miles round by huge blasts of lurid
fire; the wind tore great branches off trees,
and hurled them across the bows of our saddles,
or battered our faces with their soaked
leaves or sharp prickles. The very Dogs
were blinded and baffled by this tremendous
protest of nature; and in the very midst of
the storm there broke from an ambuscade a
band of Maroons, three times as strong as
our own, who fell upon us like incarnate
Demons as they were. Our hounds had
found their scent long before,&mdash;just after
dinner, indeed,&mdash;and we had been following
it for some two hours;&mdash;even now it was
Reeking close upon us, but we little deemed
how Near. I suppose that those Negro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Rascals, whom we had trusted so implicitly,
and on whom we thought that we could
Depend so thoroughly, had Betrayed us.
This was the second time in my short Life
that I fallen into an Ambuscade; and Lo!
each time the "Blacks" had been mixed up
with my misadventure.</p>

<p>These naked Maroons cared nothing about
the Storm, whose torrents ran off their well-oiled
carcasses like water off a Duck's back.
There was a very Devil of a fight. 'Twas
every one for himself, and the Tempest for
us all. The Runaways were well armed, and
besides could use their teeth and nails to
better advantage than many a doughty Fighting
man can use his weapons, and clawed and
tore at us like Wild Beasts. I doubt not
we should have got the worst of it, but that
we were Mounted,&mdash;and a Man on horseback
is three times a Footman in a Hand-to-Hand
encounter; and again, that our good
friends the bloodhounds, that had been scared
somewhat at the outset, recovered their self-possession,
and proceeded each to pin his
Maroon, and to rend him to pieces with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
great deliberation. In the end, that is to
say, after about twenty-seven minutes' sharp
tussling, Dogs, Horses, and Men were victorious;
and, as we surveyed the scene of
our Triumph, the storm had spent its
fury. The black clouds cleared away as
suddenly as they had darkled upon us;
the Golden Sun came out, and the dreadful
scene was lit up in Splendour. Above,
indeed, it was all Beauty and Peace for
Nature cannot be long Angry. The trees
all seemed stemmed and sprayed with glistering
jewels; the moisture that rose had
the tints of an hundred Rainbows; the long
grass flashed and waved; the many birds in
the boughs began to sing Hymns of
Thankfulness and Joy. But below, ah, me!
what a Dreadful scene of blood and Carnage,
and Demoniac revenge, there was shown!
Of our band we had lost three Killed; five
more were badly Wounded; and there was
not one of us but had some Hurt of greater
or lesser seriousness. We had killed a many
of the Maroons; and the two or three that
had escaped with Life, albeit most grievously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
gashed, were speedily put out of their misery.
Had we been seeking for Runaway house-servants,
we might have taken prisoners;
but with a wild African Maroon this is not
serviceable. The only thing that you can
do with him, when you catch him, is to kill
him.</p>

<p>The Dead Bodies of our unfortunate companions
were laid across the sumpter mule's
back; but when we came to look for our train
of dependable Negroes, we found that all save
three had fled. These did so very strongly
protest their Innocence, and plead their
abiding by us as a proof thereof, that I felt
half inclined to hold them blameless. There
were those among us, however, who were of
a far different opinion, and were for lighting
a fire of branches and Roasting them into
confession. But there was a Scotch gentleman
among us by the name of MacSawby,
who, being of a Practical turn (as most of
his countrymen are, and, indeed, Edinborough
in Scotland is about the most
Practical town that ever I was in), pointed
out that we were all very Tired, and needed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Refreshment and Repose; that the task of
Torturing Negroes gave much trouble and
consumed more time ("Aiblins it's douce
wark," quoth the Scotch gentleman); that
all the wood about was sopped with wet
(and a "Dry Roast's best," said the Scotch
Gentleman); and finally, that the thing could
be much better done at home, where we had
proper Engines and Instruments for inflicting
Exquisite Agony, and proper Slaves to
administer the same. So that for the nonce,
and for our own Convenience, we were
Merciful, and promised to defer making
necessary Inquisition, by means of Cowhide,
Tamarind-bush, and Fire-cane, until our
return to the Rendezvous.</p>

<p>I should tell you that I got a Hurt in my
hand from a kind of short Chopper or
Tommyhawk that one of the Savages carried.
'Twas fortunately my left hand, and seeming
but a mere scratch, I thought little or
nothing about it. But at the end of the
second day it began to swell and swell to a
most alarming size and tumorous discoloration,
the inflammation extending right up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
my arm, even to my shoulder. Then it
was agreed on all sides that the blade of the
Tommyhawk with which I had been stricken
must have been anointed with some subtle
and deadly Poison, of the which not only
the Maroons but the common Household
and Town Negroes have many, preparing
them themselves, and obstinately refusing,
whether by hope of Reward or fear of
punishment, to reveal the secret of their
components to the Whites. I had to rest
at the nearest Plantation to our battle-field;
and the Planter&mdash;who had been a captain
in the Chevalier de St. George's service (the
old one), that had come out here, after the
troubles of 1715, a Banished man, but had
since been pardoned, and had taken to
Planting, and grown Rich&mdash;was kind enough
to permit me to be taken into his house and
laid in one of his own Guest-chambers, where
I was not only tended by his own Domestics,
but was sometimes favoured with the Attention
and sympathy of his angelic Wife, a
young woman of most charming countenance
and lively manners, most cheerful, pious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and Humane, taking great care of her slaves,
physicking them frequently, reading to
them little books written by persons of the
Nonconforming persuasion,&mdash;a kind of
doctrine that I never could abide,&mdash;and
never suffering them to be whipped upon a
Sunday. However, I grew worse; whereupon
one Mr. Sprague, that set up for
surgeon, but was more like a Boatswain
turned landsman than that, or than a Horse,
came to me, and was for cutting off my arm,
to prevent mortification. There were two
obstacles in the way of this operation's performance;
the first being that Mr. Sprague
had no proper instruments by him beyond
a fleam and a syringe, with which, and with
however good a will, you can scarcely sever
a Man's limb from his Body; and the next
that Mr. Sprague was not sober. Love for
a young widow had driven him to drinking,
it was said; but I think that it was more
the Love of Liquor to which his bibulous
backslidings were owing. 'Twas lucky for
me that he had nor saw nor tourniquet with
him. It is true that he departed in quest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of some Carpenter's Tools, which he declared
would do the job quite as well; but, again
to my good luck, the carpenter was as Rare
a pottlepot as he; and they two took to
boiling rum in a calabash and drinking of
it, and smoking of Tobacco, and playing at
Skimming Dish Hob, Spie the Market,
Shove-halfpenny, Brag, Put, and Dilly Dally,
and other games that reminded them of the
old country, for days and nights together
so that the old Negro woman that belonged
to the carpenter, seeing them gambling
and drinking in the morning just as she
had left them drinking and gambling
the overnight, stared with amazement
like a Mouse in a Throwster's mill.
And by the time they had finished their
Rouse I was, through Heaven's kindness
and the segacity of a Negro nurse named
Cubjack, cured. This woman, it is probable
knew the secret of the Poison from the bitter
effects of which I was suffering. At all
events, she took me in hand, and by warm
fomentations and bathings, and some outward
applications of herbs and anointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
bandages, reduced the swelling and restored
my hand to its proper Form and Hue. At
the end of the week I was quite cured, and
able to resume my journey back to Kingston.
I did not fail to express my gratitude to the
hospitable Planter and his Lady, and I gave
the Nurse Cubjack half a dollar and a silver
tobacco-stopper that had been presented to
me by Maum Buckey.</p>

<p>As a perverse destiny would have it, this
Tobacco-stopper, this harmless trinket, was
the very means of my losing my situation,
and parting in anger from my Pumpkin-faced
Patroness. Although I was, even at
the present dating, but a raw lad, she took
it into her head to be jealous of me, and all
about this silver pipe-stopper. She vowed
I had given it away to some Quadroon lass
up country; she would not hearken to my
protests of having bestowed it upon the
nurse who had saved my life; and indeed
when, at my instance, inquiries were made,
Cubjack's replies did not in any way bear
out my statement. The unhappy creature,
who had probably sold my Tobacco-stopper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
for a few joes, or been deluded out of it by
the Obeah Man, and was afraid of being
flogged if discovery were made thereof,
positively denied that I had given her anything
beyond the half-dollar. You see that
these Negroes have no more idea of the
pernicious quality of the Sin of Lying, than
has a white European shopkeeper deluding
a Lady into buying of a lustring or a
paduasoy; and see what similar vices there
are engendered among savages and Christian
folks by opposite causes.</p>

<p>We had a fearful war of words together,
Maum Buckey and myself. She was a
bitter woman when vexed, and called me
"beggar buckra," "poor white trash," "tam
lily thief," and the like. Whereat I told
her plainly that I had no liking for her
lackered countenance, and that she was a
mahogany-coloured, slave-driving, old curmudgeon,
that in England would be shown
about at the fairs for a penny a peep. At
the which she screamed with rage, and threw
at me a jug of sangaree. Heavy enough it
was; but the old lady had not so good an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Aim as I had when I brained the Grenadier
with the demijohn.</p>

<p>We had little converse after that. There
were some wages due, and these she paid
me, telling me that I might "go to de
Debble," and that if she ever saw me again,
she hoped it would be to see me hanged. I
could have got Employment, I doubt not,
in Jamaica, or in some other of the islands;
but I was for the time sick of the Western
Indies, and was resolved, come what might,
to tempt my fortune in Europe. A desire
to return to England first came over me;
nor am I ashamed to confess that, mingled
with my wish to see my own country once
more, was a Hope that I might meet the
Traitorous Villain Hopwood, and tell him to
his teeth what a false Deceiver I took him
to be. You see how bold a lad can be when
he has turned the corner of sixteen; but it
was always so with John Dangerous.</p>

<p>Some difficulty, nay, considerable obstacles,
I encountered in obtaining a ship to
carry me to Europe. The vindictive yellow
woman, with whom (through no fault of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
own, I declare) I was in disfavour, did so
pursue me with her Animosity as to prejudice
one Sea Captain after another against me;
and it was long ere any would consent to
treat with me, even as a Passenger. To
those of my own nation did she in particular
speak against me with such virulence, that
in sheer despite I abandoned for the time
my intention of going to England, and determined
upon making for some other part
of Europe, where I might push my fortune.
And there being in port early in the winter
a Holland ship, named the <i>Gebr&uuml;der</i>, which
was bound for Ostend, I struck a bargain
with the skipper of her, a decent man, whose
name was Van Ganderdrom, and prepared to
leave the colony in which I had passed over
four years of my Eventful Life. Some friends
who took an interest in me,&mdash;the "bright
English lad," as they called me,&mdash;and who
thought I had been treated by Maum Buckey
with some unnecessary degree of Harshness,
made up a purse of money for me, by which
I was enabled to pay my Passage Money in
advance, and lay in a stock of Provisions for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the voyage; for, save in the way of Schnapps,
Cheeses, and Herrings, the Holland ships
were at that time but indifferently well
Found. When every thing was paid, I found
that I had indeed but a very small Surplus
remaining; but there was no other way, and
I bade adieu to the island of Jamaica, as I
thought, for ever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE THIRD.</h2>

<h3>OF WHAT BEFEL ME IN THE LOW COUNTRIES.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">I landed</span>, after a long and tedious voyage, at
the town of Ostend, it being the Spring time
of the year 1729, with Youth, Health, a
strong Frame, and a comely Countenance (as
they told me), indeed, but with just two
Guineas in my pouch for all my Fortune.
Many a Lord Mayor of London has begun
the World, 'tis said, with a yet more slender
Provision (I wonder what Harpy Hopwood
had to begin with?) and Eighteenpence
would seem to be the average of Capital
Stock for an Adventurer that is to heap up
Riches. Still I seemed to have made my
Start in Life's Voyage a great many times,
and to have been very near ending with it
more than once&mdash;witness the Aylesbury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Assizes. Thus I felt rather Despondency
than Hope at being come almost to manhood,
and but to a beggarly Estate of Two-and-forty
shillings. "But," said I, "courage,
Jack Dangerous; thou hast strong legs and
a valorous Stomach; at least thou needst not
starve (bar cutpurses) for two-and-forty days;
thou hast a knowledge of the French tongue,"
(which I picked up from a Huguenot emigrant
from Languedoc, who was a Barber at
Kingston, and taught me for well-nigh
nothing), "and art cunning of Fence. Be
the world thine Oyster, as the Playactor has
it, and e'en open it with a Spadapoint." In
this not unwholesome frame of mind I came
out of the ship <i>Gebr&uuml;der</i>, and set foot on the
Port with something like a Defiance of Fortune's
scurvy tricks fermenting within me.</div>

<p>The Shipmaster recommended me to a very
cleanly Tavern, by the sign of the Red
Goose, kept in the Ganz-Straet by a widow-woman
named Giessens. 'Twas Goose here,
Goose there, and Goose every where, so it
seemed with this good Frau; for she served
Schiedam at the sign of the Goose, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
lived in Goose Street. She had herself a
long neck and a round body and flat feet,
going waddling and hissing about the house,
a-scolding of her maids, like any Michaelmas
matron among the stubble; not to forget
her children, of whom she had a flock,
waddling and hissing in their little way too,
and who were all as like goslings as Sherris
is like Sack. Little would have lacked for
her to give me hot roast goose to my dinner,
and goose-pie for supper, and some unguent
of goose-grease to anoint my Pate with,
had it chanced to be broken; and truly if I
had lived under the sign of the Goose for
many days, I might have taken to waddling
and hissing too in my own Generation, and
have been in time as brave a goose as any of
them. Here there was a civil enough company
of Seafaring men, Mates, Pilots, Supercargoes,
and the like, with some Holland
traders, and, if I mistake not, a few Smugglers
that had contraband dealings in Cambrics,
Steenkirks, Strong waters, and Point
of Bruxelles. These last worthies did I carefully
avoid; for since my Boyish Mischances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
I had imbibed a wholesome fear of hurting
the King's Revenue, or meddling in any way
with his Prerogative. "Well out of it, Jack
Dangerous," I said. "Touch not His Majesty's
Deer, nor His Majesty's Customs, and
there shall be no sense of a tickling in thy
windpipe when thou passest a post that is
like unto the sign of the Tyburn Tavern."
'Tis astonishing how gingerly a man will
walk who has once been within an ace of
dancing upon nothing.</p>

<p>There is a mighty quantity of Sand and
good store of Mud at Ostend, and a very
comforting smell of fish; and so the High
Dutch gentry, who, poor souls, know very
little about the sea, and see no more salt
water from Life's beginning unto its end than
is contained within the compass of a pickling-tub,
do use the place much for Bathing, and
brag about their Dips and Flounderings,
crying out, <i>Die Zee ist mein Lust</i>, in their
plat Deutsch, as though they had all been
born so many Porpoises. I would walk upon
a morning much upon the Ramping-Parts,
or Fortifications of the Town, watching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
whole caravans of Bathers, both of High and
Low Dutch Gentry, coming to be dipped,
borne into the Sea by sturdy Fellows that
carried them like so many Sacks of Coals,
and who would Discharge them into shallows
with little more Ceremony than they would
use in shooting such a cargo of Fuel into a
cellar. "When my Money is gone," thought
I, "I may earn a crust by the like labour."
But then I bethought me that I was a
Stranger among them; that they might be
Jealous of me; and, indeed, when I imparted
my design to the Widow-woman Giessens,
who was beholden to me, she said, for that
I had warned her how poor a guest I was
growing, she told me that much interest was
needed to obtain one of these Bather's places&mdash;almost
as much, forsooth, as is wanted to
get the berth of a Tide-waiter in England,&mdash;and
these rascals were always waiting for
the tide. Something like a Patent had to be
humbly sued for, and fat fees paid to Syndics
and Burgomasters, for the fine Privilege of
sousing the gentry in the Brine. The good
woman offered me Credit till I should find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
employment, and did so vehemently press a
couple of Guilders upon me to defray my
present charges, that I had not the heart to
refuse, although I took care to avise her that
my prospects of being able to repay her were
as far off as the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>It chanced one morning that I was walking
out of the Town by the side of the Sea
below the fortified parts to the Norrard.
'Twas fine and calm enough, and there was
not so much Swell as to take a Puppy off his
swimming legs; but suddenly I heard a great
Outcry and Hubbub, and perceived, some ten
feet from me in the Water the head of a Man
convulsed with Terror, and who was crying
out with all his might that he was Drowning,
that he should never see his dear Mamma
again, and that all his Estate would go to the
Heir-at-Law, whom, as well as he could,
for screeching and spluttering, he Cursed
heartily in the English tongue. I wondered
how he could be in such a Pother, seeing
that he was so close to shore, and that moreover
there were those nigh unto him who
could have helped him if they had had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Mind to it. Close upon him was a Fat gentleman
in a clergyman's cassock and a prodigious
Fluster, who kept crying out, "Save
him! Save him!" but budged not a foot to
come to his assistance himself; and, but a
dozen yards or so, was a Flemish Fellow, one
of the Bathers, who, so far as I could make
out from his shaking his head and crying
out, "nicht" and "Geld,"&mdash;the rest of his
lingo was Greek to me,&mdash;did refuse to save
the Gentleman unless he had more Money
given him. For these Bathing-men were a
most Mercenary Pack. In a much shorter
time than it has taken me to put this on
Paper I had off coat and vest, kicked off my
shoes, and struck into the water. 'Twas of
the shallowest, and I had but to wade towards
him who struggled. When I came
anigh him, he must even catch hold of me,
clinging like Grim Death or a Barnacle to
the bottom of a Barge, very nearly dragging
me down. But I was happily strong; and
so, giving him with my disengaged arm a
sound Cuff under the ear, the better to Preserve
his Life, I seized him by the waist with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the other, and so dragged him up high, if not
dry, unto the Sandy Shore. And a pretty
sight he looked there, dripping and Shivering,
although the sun shone Brightly, and he well
nigh Blue with Fright.</p>

<p>What do you think the first words were
that my Gentleman uttered so soon as he
had got his tongue clear of Salt and Seaweed?</p>

<p>"You villain!" he cries to me, "you have
assaulted me. Take witness, Gentlemen, he
hath stricken me under the Ear. I will
have him in the King's Bench for Battery.
Mr. Hodge, you saw it; and you leave me
this day week for allowing your Patron to
be within an inch of Drowning."</p>

<p>I was always of a Hot Temper, and this
cavalier treatment of me after my Services
threw me into a Rage.</p>

<p>"Why, you little half-boiled Shrimp," I
bawled out, "I have a mind to clout your
under t'other Ear, that Brothers may not
complain of Favour, and e'en carry you to
where I found you."</p>

<p>The Gentleman in the cassock began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
break out in excuses, saying that his Patron
would reward me, and that he was glad that
an Englishman had been by to rescue a
Person of Quality from such great Peril,
when that Flanders Oaf younger&mdash;the extortionate
villain&mdash;would not stir a finger to
help him unless he had half a guilder over
and above his fee.</p>

<p>"Let him dry and dress himself," I said,
in Dudgeon; "and if he be not civil to a
Countryman, who is as good as he, I will
kick him back to his Inn, and you too."</p>

<p>"A desperate youth!" murmured the
Clergyman, as he handed his Patron a great
bundle of towels; "and very meanly clad."</p>

<p>I walked away a few paces while the
gentleman dried and dressed himself. Had
I obeyed the Promptings of Pride, I should
have gone on my ways and left him to his
likings; but I was exceedingly Poor, and
thought it Foolish to throw away the chance
of receiving what his Generosity might bestow
upon me. The Bathing-Man, who had
been already paid his Fee, had the impudence
to come up and ask for more "Geld,"&mdash;for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
minding the gentleman's clothes, as I
gathered from the speech of the clergyman,
who understood Flemish. He was, however,
indignantly refused, and, not relishing,
perchance, the likelihood of a scuffle with
three Englishmen, straightway decamped.</p>

<p>By and by the Gentleman was dressed,
and a very smart appearance he made in a
blue shag frock laced with silver, a yellow
waistcoat bound with black velvet, green
paduasoy breeches, red stockings, gold
buckles, an ivory hilt to his sword, and a
white feather in his hat. I have no mind to
write out Taylor's accompts, but I do declare
this to be the exact Schedule of his
Equipment. Under the hat, which had a
kind of Sunday Marylabonne cock to it,
there bulged forth a mighty White Periwig
of fleecy curls, for all the world like the coat
of a Bologna Poodle Dog, and in the middle
of his Wig there peeped out a little hatchet
face with lantern jaws, and blue gills, and a
pair of great black eyebrows, under which
glistened a pair of inflamed eyes. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
not above five feet three inches, and his
fingers, very long and skinny, went to and
fro under his Point ruffles like a Lobster's
Feelers. The Chaplain, who waited upon
him as a Maid would on a lardy-dardy woman
of Fashion, handed my Gentleman a very
tall stick with a golden knob at the end on't,
and with this, and a laced handkerchief and
a long cravat, which he had likely bought at
Mechlin, and a Snuff-box in the lean little
Paw that held not the cane, he looked for
all the world like one of my Grandmother's
Footmen who had run away and turned
Dancing Master.</p>

<p>"This, young man," said the Chaplain,
making a low bow as he spoke to the comical
Image before him, "is Bartholomew Pinchin,
Esquire, of Hampstead. Make your reverence,
sirrah!"</p>

<p>"Make a reverence to a Rag-doll!" I
answered, with a sneer. "He hath left his
twin brother beyond sea. I know him, and
he is a Barbary Ape."</p>

<p>"The rogue is insolent," says B. Pinchin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Esq., clutching tighter at his tall cane, but
turning very white the while. "I must
batoon him into better manners."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">What!</span>" I cried in a great voice, making
a step towards him, for my blood was up. I
would but have tweaked the little creature's
Ears; but he, for a surety, thought I had a
mind to Murder him. I do aver that he fell
upon his knees, and with most piteous Accents
and Protestations entreated me, for
the sake of his Mamma, to spare his life,
and he would give me all I asked.</p>

<p>I was quite bewildered, and turning towards
the Parson, asked if his master was
Mad; to which he made answer with some
Heat, that he was no Master of his, but his
Honoured Friend and Gracious Patron;
whereupon the little Spark must go up to
him, whimpering and cuddling about him,
and beseeching him to save him from the
Tall Rogue, meaning me.</p>

<p>"Body o' me, man," I exclaimed, scarcely
able to keep from laughing, "I mean you
no harm. I am a young Englishman, lately
come from the Plantations, and seeking employment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
I see you struggling yonder,
and likely to give up the ghost, and I pull
you out; and then you call me Rogue and
charge me with striking of you. Was it
cramp or cowardice that made you bawl so?
Give me something to drink better manners
to you, and I will leave you and this reverend
gentleman alone."</p>

<p>The Parson bowed his head with a pleased
look when I called him Reverend and a
Gentleman, and, in an under-tone, told his
Patron that I was a civilly behaved youth,
after all. But the Poltroon with the white
wig was not out of his Pother yet. He had
risen to his feet with a patch of sand on
each knee, and as the Chaplain wiped it off
with a kerchief, he blubbered out that I
wanted to rob him.</p>

<p>The Clergyman whispered in his ear&mdash;perhaps
that I was a Dangerous looking
Fellow, and might lose my temper anon to
some tune: for my Whippersnapper approaches
me, and, in a manner Civil enough,
tells me that he is much obliged for what I
had done for him. "And you will take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
this," says he. I will be shot if he did not
give me an English groat.</p>

<p>"You can readily get English coin changed
in the town," he observed with a smirk, as
in sheer bewilderment I gazed upon this
paltry doit.</p>

<p>I was desperately minded to Fling it at
him, knock him and the Chaplain down, and
leave the precious pair to pick themselves
up again, but I forebore. "Well," I said,
"if that's the value you put upon your life,
I can't grumble at your Guerdon. I suppose
that shrivelled little carcass of yours
isn't worth more than fourpence. I'll e'en
change it in town, and buy fourpennyworth
of Dutch cheese, and you shall have the
parings for nothing to send to your Mamma
as a gift from foreign parts. Good morning
to you, my noble Captain." And so saying
I walked away in a Fume of Wrath and
Contempt.</p>

<p>I was idling, that same afternoon, along
the Main street of Ostend very much in the
Dumps, and thinking of going down to the
Port to seek a cook's place from some Ship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Master, for I was not yet Qualified to engage
as an Able-bodied Mariner, when I
met the Chaplain again, this time alone,
and coming out of a pastryman's shop. I
would have passed him, as holding both him
and his master in Disdain, but he Arrested
me, and beckoned me into an Entry, there
to have some Speech.</p>

<p>"My Patron is somewhat quick and hasty,
and was uncommonly flustered by his mischance
this morning," quoth the Rev. Mr.
Hodge. "Nor perhaps did he use you as
liberally as he should have done. Here is a
golden guilder for you, honest man."</p>

<p>I thanked him, and as I pouched it told
him that I would have taken no Money at
all for a service which every man is bound
to render to his Fellow-creature, but that I
was sorely pressed for Money. On this, he
asked my name and belongings. The name
I gave him, at the which he winced somewhat;
but of my history I did not care to
enlighten him further beyond broadly stating
that I had come from the Plantations,
where I had been used to keep Accompts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and that I was an Orphan, and had no
friends in England, even if I possessed the
means to return thither.</p>

<p>"I think I can find you a place," the
chaplain replied, when I had finished.
"'Twill not be a very handsome one, but
the work is little and light. Would it meet
your purpose, now, to attend on a gentleman?"</p>

<p>"It depends," I replied, "on what kind of
a Gentleman he is."</p>

<p>"A Gentleman of landed Estate," quoth
the parson, quite pat. "An English gentleman,
now travelling for his Diversion,
but will, in good time, settle down in England,
to live on his Acres in a Handsome
manner, and be a justice of peace, and of
the Quorum."</p>

<p>"Do you mean your Squire of Hampstead,
yonder?" I answered, pointing my
thumb over my shoulder, as though in the
direction where I had met his Reverence
and his Patron that morning.</p>

<p>"I do," responds Mr. Hodge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bartholomew Pinchin, of Hampstead,
Esquire, eh?" I continued.</p>

<p>"Exactly so."</p>

<p>"Then," I went on, raising my voice, and
giving a furious glance at my companion,
"I'll see Bartholomew Pinchin boiled, and
I'll see Bartholomew Pinchin baked, and his
Esquireship to boot, before I'll be his servant.
He, a mean, skulking, pinchbeck
hound! Tell him I'm meat for his master,
and that he has no service, body or lip, of
mine."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, you foolish lad," said Mr.
Hodge, not in the least offended. "What
a wild young colt it is, and how impatient!
For all your strapping figure, now, I doubt
whether you are twenty years of age."</p>

<p>I answered, with something like a Blush,
that I was not yet seventeen.</p>

<p>"There it is,&mdash;there it is," the Chaplain
took me, chuckling. "As I thought. A
mere boy. A very lad. Not come to years
of discretion yet, and never will, if he goes
on raging in this manner. Hearken to me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
youngster. Don't be such a fool as to throw
away a good chance."</p>

<p>"I don't see where it is yet," I observed
sulkily yet sheepishly; for there was a
Good-natured air about the Chaplain that
overcame me.</p>

<p>"But I do," he rejoined. "The good
chance you have is of getting a comfortable
place, with a smart livery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't wear a livery," I cried, in a
heat. "I'll be no man's lacquey; I'm a
gentleman."</p>

<p>"So was Adam," retorted Mr. Hodge,
"and the very first of the breed; but he
had to wear a livery of fig-leaves for all that,
and so had his wife, Eve. Come, 'tis better
to don a land-jerkin, and a hat with a ribbon
to 't, and be a Gentleman's Gentleman,
with regular Wages and Vails, and plenty
of good Victuals every day, than to be
starving and in rags about the streets of a
Flemish town."</p>

<p>"I'm not starving; I'm not in rags," I
protested, with my Proud stomach.</p>

<p>"But you will be the day after to-morrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
The two things always go together.
Come, my young friend, I'll own that Bartholomew
Pinchin, Esquire, is not generous."</p>

<p>"Generous!" I exclaimed; "why, he's
the meanest little hunks that ever lanced
a paving stone to find blood for black
puddings in it. Didn't he give me fourpence
this morning for saving his life?"</p>

<p>"And didn't you tell him that his life
wasn't worth more than a groat?" asked
the Chaplain, with a sly grin; "besides insulting
him on the question of Dutch cheese
(to which he has an exquisite aversion), into
the bargain?"</p>

<p>"That's true," I replied, vanquished by
the Parson's logic.</p>

<p>"There, then," his Reverence went on.
"Bartholomew Pinchin Esquire's more
easily managed than you think for. Do
you prove a good servant, and it shall be
my duty to make him show himself a good
master to you. But I must have no further
parley with you here, else these Papistical
Ostenders will think that you are some
Flemish lad (for indeed you have somewhat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of a foreign air), and I a Lutheran Minister
striving to convert you. Get you back to
your Inn, good youth. Pay your score, if
you have one, and if you have not, e'en
spend your guilder in treating of your companions,
and come to me at nine of the
clock this evening at the Inn of the Three
Archduchesses. Till then, fare you well."</p>

<p>It must be owned that his Reverence's
proposals were fair, and that his conversation
was very civil. As I watched him
trotting up the Main Street, his Cassock
bulging out behind, I agreed with myself
that perhaps the most prudent thing I could
do just at present would be to put my gentility
in my pocket till better times came
round. There was a Spanish Don, I believe,
once upon a time, who did very nearly the
same thing with his sword.</p>

<p>At the appointed time I duly found myself
at the sign of the Three Archduchesses,
which was the bravest Hostelry in all
Ostend, and the one where all the Quality
put up. I asked for Bartholomew Pinchin,
Esquire, in the best French that I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
muster; whereupon the drawer, who was a
Fleming, and, I think, spoke even worse
French than I did, asked me if I meant the
English Lord who had the grand suite of
apartments looking on the courtyard. I was
fit to die of laughing at first to hear the
trumpery little Hampstead squire spoken of
as a lord; but Prudence came to my aid
again, and I answered that such was the
personage I came to seek; and, after not
much delay, I was ushered into the presence
of Mr. Pinchin, whose Esquiredom&mdash;and
proud enough he was of it&mdash;I may now as
well Drop. I found him in a very handsome
apartment, richly furnished, drinking
Burgundy with his chaplain, and with a
pack of cards alongside the bottles, and
two great wax candles in sconces on either
side. But, as he drank his Burgundy, he
ceased not to scream and whimper at the
expense he was being put to in having such
a costly liquor at his table, and scolded
Mr. Hodge very sorely because he had not
ordered some thin Bordeaux, or light Rhine
wine. "I'm drinking guineas," he moaned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
as he gulped down his Goblets; "it'll be
the ruin of me. A dozen of this is as bad
as a Mortgage upon my Titmouse Farm.
What'll my mamma say? I shall die in the
poor-house." But all this time he kept on
drinking; and it was not glass and glass
about with him, I promise you, for he took
at least three bumpers full to his Chaplain's
one, and eyed that reverend personage grudgingly
as he seized his opportunity, and
brimmed up the generous Red Liquor in
his tall-stemmed glass. Yet the Chaplain
seemed in no way discountenanced by his
scanty allowance, and I thought that, perchance,
his Reverence liked not wine of
Burgundy.</p>

<p>They were playing a hand of piquet when
I was introduced; and they being Gentlefolks,
and I a poor humble Serving Man that
was to be, I was bidden to wait, which I did
very patiently in the embrasure of a window,
admiring the great dark tapestried curtains
as they loomed in indistinct gorgeousness
among the shadows. The hand of piquet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
was over at last, and Mr. Pinchin found that
he had lost three shillings and sixpence.</p>

<p>"I can't pay it, I can't pay it," he said,
making a most rueful countenance. "I'm
eaten out of house and home, and sharped at
cards besides. It's a shame for a Parson to
play foul,&mdash;I say foul, Mr. Hodge. It's a
disgrace to the cloth to bring your wicked
card-cheating practices to devalise an English
gentleman who is travelling for his
diversion."</p>

<p>"We'll play the game over again, if you
choose, Worthy Sir," the Chaplain answers
quite quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes, and then you'll win seven shillings
of me. You've sworn to bring me to beggary
and ruin. I know you swore it when
my mamma sent you abroad with me. Oh,
why did I come to foreign parts with a
wicked, guzzling, gambling, chambering
Chaplain, that's in league with the very host
and the drawers of this thieving inn against
me&mdash;that burns me a guinea a night in wax
candles, and has had a freehold farm out of
me in Burgundy wine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've have had but two glasses the entire
evening," the Chaplain pleaded, in a voice
truly that was meek; but I thought that,
even at the distance I stood from him, I
could see the colour rising in his cheek.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have, you have," went on Squire
Bartholomew, who, if not half Mad, was
certainly more than three parts Muzzy;
"you've ruined me, Mr. Hodge, with your
cards and your candles and your Burgundy,
and Goodness only knows what else besides."</p>

<p>The Chaplain could stand it no longer;
and rose in a Rage.</p>

<p>"I wish all the candles and the cards were
down your throat," he cried; "nearly all the
wine is there already. I wish they'd choke
you. I wish they were all in the pit of your
stomach, and turned to hot burning coals.
What shall I do with you, you cadaverous
little jackanapes? The Lout did well this
morning&mdash;"(I was the Lout, by your leave)
"to&mdash;to liken thee to one, for thou art more
monkey than man. But for fear of staining
my cassock, I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>He advanced towards him with a vengeful
air, clenching his fist, as well as I could
see, as he approached. Surely there never
was such a comical character as this Bartholomew
Pinchin. 'Tis the bare truth, that, as
the enraged parson came at him, this Gentleman
of broad acres drops down again on his
marrowbones, just as I had seen him on the
sands in the morning; and lifting up his
little skinny hands towards the ceiling,
begins yelling and bawling out louder than
ever.</p>

<p>"Spare my life! spare my life!" he cried,
"Take my watch and trinkets. Take my
Gold Medal of the Pearl of Brunswick Club.
Take the diamond solitaire I wear in my
great Steenkirk on Sundays. Go to my
Bankers, and draw every penny I've got in
the world. Turn me out a naked, naked
Pauper; but oh, Mr. Hodge spare my life.
I'm young. I've been a sinner. I want to
give a hundred Pounds to Lady Wackerbarth's
charity school. I want to do every
body good. Take my gold, but spare my
life. Oh, you tall young man in the corner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
there, come and help an English gentleman
out of the hands of a murtherous Chaplain."</p>

<p>"Why, you craven cur, you," puts in the
Chaplain, bending over him with half-poised
fist, yet with a kind of half-amusement in
his features, "don't you know that the Tall
young Man, as you call him, is the poor
English lad who saved your worthless little
carcass from drowning this morning, and
whom you offered to recompense with a
Scurvy Groat."</p>

<p>"I'll give him forty pound, I will," blubbered
Mr. Pinchin, still on his knees. "I'll
give him fifty pound when my Midsummer
rents come in, only let him rescue me from
the jaws of the roaring lion. Oh, my Mamma!
my mamma!"</p>

<p>"Come forward, then, young man," cried
the Chaplain, with a smile of disdain on his
good-humoured <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'coutenance'">countenance</ins>, "and help this
worthy and courageous gentleman to his
legs. Don't be afraid, Squire Barty. <i>He</i>
won't murder you."</p>

<p>I advanced in obedience to the summons,
and putting a hand under either armpit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the Squire, helped him on to his feet. Then,
at a nod of approval, I set him in the great
arm-chair of Utrecht velvet. Then I pointed
to the bottle on the table, and looked at Mr.
Hodge, as though to ask whether he thought
a glass of Burgundy would do the patient
good.</p>

<p>"No," said the Chaplain. "He's had
enough Burgundy. He'd better have a
flask of champagne to give him some spirits.
Will you drink a flask of champagne,
Squire?" he continued, addressing his patron
in a strangely authoritative voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," quoth the little man, whose periwig
was all Awry, and who looked, on the
whole, a most doleful figure,&mdash;"yes, if you
please, Mr. Hodge."</p>

<p>"Vastly pretty! And what am I to have?
<i>I</i> think I should like some Burgundy."</p>

<p>"Any thing," murmured the discomfited
Squire; "only spare my&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tush! your life's in no danger. <i>We'll</i>
take good care of it. And this most obliging
English youth,&mdash;will your Honour offer
him no refreshment? What is he to have?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can he drink beer?" asked the Squire,
in a faint voice, and averting his head, as
though the having to treat me was too much
for him.</p>

<p>"Can you drink beer?" echoed the Chaplain,
looking at me, but shaking his head
meanwhile, as if to warn me not to consent
to partake of so cheap a beverage.</p>

<p>"It's very cheap," added Mr. Pinchin,
very plaintively. "It isn't a farthing a glass;
and when you get used to it, it's better for
the inwards than burnt brandy. Have a
glass of beer, good youth. Kind Mr. Hodge,
let them bring him a glass of Faro."</p>

<p>"Hang your faro! I don't like it," I said,
bluntly.</p>

<p>"What will you have, then?" asked the
Squire, with a gasp of agony, and his head
still buried in the chair-cushion.</p>

<p>It seemed that the Chaplain's lips, as he
looked at me, were mutely forming the
letters W&nbsp;I&nbsp;N&nbsp;E. So I put a bold front
upon it, and said,</p>

<p>"Why, I should like, master, to drink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
your health in a bumper of right Burgundy
with this good Gentleman here."</p>

<p>"He will have Burgundy," whimpered
Mr. Pinchin, half to the chair-cushion, and
half to his periwig. "He will have Burgundy.
The ragged, tall young man will
have Burgundy at eight livres ten sols the
flask. Oh, let him have it, and let me die!
for he and the Parson have sworn to my
Mamma to murder me and have my blood,
and leave me among Smugglers, and Papistry,
and Landlords who have sworn to ruin me in
waxen candles."</p>

<p>There was something at once so ludicrous,
and yet so Pathetic, in the little man's
lamentations, that I scarcely knew whether
to laugh or to cry. His feelings seemed so
very acute, and he himself so perfectly sincere
in his moanings and groanings, that it
was almost Barbarity to jeer at him. The
Chaplain, however, was, to all appearance,
accustomed to these little Comedies; for,
whispering to me that it was all Mr. Pinchin's
manner, and that the young Gentleman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
meant no harm, he bade me bestir myself
and hurry up the servants of the House
to serve supper. So not only were the
champagne and the Burgundy put on table,&mdash;and
of the which there was put behind a
screen a demiflask of the same true vintage
for my own private drinking. ("And the
Squire will be pleased, when he comes to
Audit the score, to find that you have been
content with Half a bottle. 'Twill seem
like something saved out of the Fire,"
whispers the Chaplain to me, as I helped to
lay the cloth),&mdash;not only were Strong
Waters and sweet Liquors and cordials provided,
especially that renowned stomachic
the Maraschyno, of which the Hollanders
and Flemings are so outrageously fond,
and which is made to such perfection in the
Batavian settlements in Asia, but a substantial
Repast likewise made its appearance,
comprising Fowl, both wild and tame, and
hot and cold, a mighty pasty of veal and
eggs, baked in a Standing Crust, some
curious fresh sallets, and one of potatoes
and salted herrings flavoured with garlic&mdash;to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
me most villanously nasty, but much
affected in these amphibious Low Countries.
So, the little Squire being brought to with a
copious draught of champagne,&mdash;and he was
the most weazened little Bacchus I ever
knew, moistening his ever-dry throttle from
morn until night,&mdash;he and the chaplain sate
down to supper, and remained feasting until
long past midnight. So far as the Parson's
part went, it might have been called a
Carouse as well as a Feast, for his Reverence
took his Liquor, and plenty of it, with a
joviality of Countenance the which it would
have done your Heart good to see, drinking
"Church and King," and then "King and
Church," so that neither Institution should
have cause to grumble, and then giving the
Army, the Navy, the Courts of Quarter
Sessions throughout England, Newmarket
and the horses, not forgetting the Jockeys,
the pious memory of Dr. Sacheverell, at
which the Squire winced somewhat, for he
was a bitter Whig, with many other elegant
and appropriate sentiments. In fact, it was
easy to see that his reverence had known the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
very best of company, and when at one of
the clock he called for a Bowl of Punch,
which he had taught the Woman of the
House very well how to brew, I put him
down as one who had sate with Lords,&mdash;ay
and of the Council too, over their Potations.
But the Behaviour of Bartholomew Pinchin,
Esquire, was, from the beginning unto the
end of the Regale, of a piece with his former
extraordinary and Grotesque conduct. After
the champagne, he essayed to sing a song to
the tune of "Cold and Raw," but, failing
therein, he began to cry. Then did he accuse
me of having secreted the Liver Wing of a
Capon, which, I declare, I had seen him devour
not Five Minutes before. Then he
had more Drink, and proposed successively
as Toasts his Cousin Lady Betty Heeltap,
daughter to my Lord Poddle; a certain
Madame Van Foorst, whom I afterwards
discovered to be the keeper of a dancing
Ridotto on the Port at Antwerp; then the
Jungfrau, or serving wench that waited
upon us, who had for name Babette; and
lastly his Mamma, whom, ten minutes afterwards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
he began to load with Abuse, declaring
that she wished to have her Barty shut
up in a madhouse, in order that she might
enjoy his Lands and Revenues. And then
he fell to computing the cost of the supper,
swearing that it would Ruin him, and making
his old complaints about those eternal
wax candles. Then, espying me out, he
asks who I am, challenges me to fight with
him for a Crown, vows that he will delate
me to the English Resident at Brussels for
a Jacobite spy, tells me that I am an Honest
Fellow, and, next to Mr. Hodge, the best
friend he ever had in the world, and falls
down at last stupefied. Whereupon, with
the assistance of the Flemish Drawer, I
carried my new master up to bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE FOURTH.</h2>


<h3>I MAKE THE GRAND TOUR, AND ACQUIRE SOME KNOWLEDGE
OF THE POLITE WORLD.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">For</span> I had decided that he was to be my
Master. "I can bear with his strange ways,"
I said to myself. "John Dangerous has
seen stranger, young as he is; and it will
go hard if this droll creature does not furnish
forth some sport, ay and some Profit too,
before long." For now that I had put my
Gentility in my pocket, I began to remember
that Hay is a very pleasant and toothsome
thing for Fodder, to say nothing of its having
a most pleasant odour, and that the best
time to make hay was while the sun did
shine.</div>

<p>After I had assisted in conveying the
Little Man to bed, I came down again to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the Saloon, finding there Mr. Hodge, who
was comforting himself with a last bumper
of punch before seeking bed.</p>

<p>"Well, Youth," he accosts me, "have
you thought better of your surly, huffing
manner of this morning and this afternoon?"</p>

<p>I told him that I had, and that I desired
nothing better than to enter forthwith into
the service of Bartholomew Pinchin, Esquire,
of Hampstead.</p>

<p>"That's well," said his Reverence, nodding
at me over his punch. "You've had
your supper behind yon screen, haven't you?"</p>

<p>I answered, "Yes, and my Burgundy
likewise."</p>

<p>"That you mustn't expect every day,"
he continues, "but only on extraordinary
occasions such as that of to-night. What
the living is like, you have seen. The best
of fish, flesh, and fowl, and plenty of it. As
to your Clothes and your Wages, we will
hold discourse of that in the morning; for
'twill take your Master half the morning to
beat you down a penny a Month, and quarrel
with the Tailor about the cheapest kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
serge for your Livery. Leave it to me,
however, and I'll engage that you have no
reason to complain either of one or the other.
What did you say your name was, friend?
As for Recommendations, you have none to
Give, and I seek not any from you. I will
be content to take your character from your
Face and Speech."</p>

<p>I began to stammer and bow and thank
his Honour's Reverence for his good opinion.</p>

<p>"Don't thank me before you're asked,"
answers Mr. Hodge, with a grin. "The
academy of compliments is not held here.
By your speech you have given every sign
of being a very Saucy Fellow, and, to judge
from your face, you have all the elements in
you of a complete Scoundrel."</p>

<p>I bowed, and was silent.</p>

<p>"But your name," he pursued, "that has
escaped me."</p>

<p>I answered Respectfully that I had used
to be called John Dangerous.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" Mr. Hodge cried out hastily.
"Fie upon the name! John is all very
well; but Dangerous will never do. Why,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
our Patron would think directly he heard it
that you were bent on cutting his throat, or
running away with his valise."</p>

<p>I submitted, again with much respect,
that it was the only name I had.</p>

<p>"Well, thou art a straightforward youth,"
said the Chaplain good-humouredly, "and
I will not press thee to take up an alias.
John will serve excellently well for the
present; and, if more be wanted, thou shalt
be John D. But understand that the name
of Dangerous is to remain a secret between
me and thee and the Post."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," I cried, "so long
as the Post be not a gallows."</p>

<p>"Well said, John D.," murmured Mr.
Hodge, upon whom by this time the punch
had taken some little effect. "A good Lad,
John. And now thou mayst help me up to
bed."</p>

<p>And so I did, for his Reverence had begun
to stagger. Then a pallet was found for me
high up in the Roof of the Inn of the Three
Archduchesses. I forbore to grumble, for
I had been used from my first going out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
into the world to Hard Lodging. And that
night I slept very soundly, and dreamt that
I was in the Great Four-post Bed at my
Grandmother's in Hanover Square.</p>

<p>Never had a Man, I suppose, in this
Mortal World, ever so droll a master as
this Bartholomew Pinchin, of Hampstead,
Esquire. 'Tis Tame, and may be Offensive,
for me to be so continually telling that he
wrote himself down <i>Armiger</i>, after my
Promise to forego for the future such recapitulation
of his Title; but Mr. Pinchin
was himself never tired of dubbing himself
Esquire, and you could scarcely be five
Minutes in his company without hearing of
his Estate, and his Mamma, and his Right
to bear Arms. I, who was by birth a
Gentleman of Long Descent, could not forbear
Smiling from time to time (in my
Sleeve, be it understood, since I was a
Servant at Wages to him) at his ridiculous
Assumptions. And there are few things
more Contemptible, I take it, than for a Man
of really good Belongings, and whose Lineage
is as old as Stonehenge (albeit, for Reasons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
best known to Himself, he permits his
Pedigree to lie Perdu), to hear an Upstart
of Yesterday Bragging and Swelling that he
is come from this or from that, when we,
who are of the true Good Stock, know very
well, but that we are not so ill-mannered as
to say so, that he is sprung from Nothing at
all. I think that if the Heralds were to
make their Journeys now, as of Yore, among
the Country Churchyards, and hack out
from the Headstones the sculptured cognizances
of those having no manner of Right
to them, the Stone-Masons about Hyde
Park Corner would all make Fortunes from
the orders that would be given to them for
fresh Tombs. Not a mealy-mouthed Burgess
now, whose great-grandfather sold stocking
hose to my Lord Duke of Northumberland,
but sets himself up for a Percy; not a supercilious
Cit, whose Uncle married a cast-off
waiting-woman from Arundel Castle, but
vaunts himself on his alliance with the
noble house of Howard; not a starveling
Scrivener, whose ancestor, as the playwright
has it, got his Skull cracked by John of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Gaunt for crowding among the Marshalmen
in the Tilt Yard, but must pertly Wink and
Snigger, and say that the Dukedom of
Lancaster would not be found extinct if the
Right Heir chose to come Forward. Since
that poor young Lord of the Lakes was
attainted for his part in the Troubles of the
'Fifteen, and lost his head on Tower Hill
(his vast Estates going to Greenwich
Hospital), I am given to understand that
every man in Cumberland or Westmoreland
whose name happens to be Ratcliffe (I knew
the late Mr. Charles Ratcliffe, that Suffered
with a Red Feather in his Hat, very well),
must give himself out to be titular Earl of
Derwentwater, and Importune the Government
to reverse the Attainder, and restore
him the Lands of which the Greenwich
Commissioners have gotten such a tight
Hold; and as for Grandchildren of the by-blows
of King Charles II., good lack! to
hear them talk of the "Merry Monarch,"
and to see them draw up their Eyebrows
into the Stuart Frown, one would think that
every Player-Woman at the King's or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Duke's House had been as favoured in her
time as Madam Eleanour Gwyn.</p>

<p>Thus do I no more believe that Mr.
Bartholomew Pinchin was cousin to Lady
Betty Heeltap, or in any manner connected
with the family of my Lord Poddle (and he
was only one of the Revolution Peers, that got
his coronet for Ratting at the right moment
to King William III.), than that he was the
Great Mogul's Grandmother. His gentlemanly
extraction was with him all a Vain
Pretence and silly outward show. It did
no very great Harm, however. When the
French adventurer Poirier asked King Augustus
the Strong to make him a Count,
what said his Majesty of Warsaw and Luneville?
"That I cannot do," quoth he;
"but there is nothing under the sun to
prevent thee from calling thyself a Count, if
the humour so please thee." And Count
Poirier, by Self-Creation, he straightway
became, and as Count Poirier was knouted
to Death at Moscow for Forging of Rubles
Assignats. Pinchin was palpably a Plebeian;
but it suited him to be called and to call himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
an Esquire; and who should gainsay
him? At the Three Archduchesses at Ostend,
indeed, they had an exceeding sensible Plan
regarding Titles and Precedence for Strangers,
which was found to answer admirably
well. He who took the Grand Suite, looking
upon the courtyard, was always held to be
an English Lord. The tenant of the floor
above him was duly esteemed by the Drawers
and Chamberlains to be a Count of the Holy
Roman Empire; a quiet gentleman, who
would pay a Louis a day for his charges, but
was content to dine at the Public Table, was
put down as a Baron or a Chevalier; those
who occupied the rooms running round the
galleries were saluted Merchants, or if they
chose it, Captains; but, in the gardens
behind the Inn, there stood a separate
Building, called a Pavilion, most sumptuously
appointed, and the Great Room hung
with the Story of Susannah and the Elders
in Arras Tapestry; and he who would pay
enough for this Pavilion might have been
hailed as an Ambassador Plenipotentiary, as
a Duke and Peer of France, or even as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Sovereign Prince travelling incognito, had
he been so minded. For what will not
Money do? Take our English Army, for
instance, which is surely the Bravest and
the Worst Managed in the whole World.
My Lord buys a pair of colours for the Valet
that has married his Leman, and forthwith
Mr. Jackanapes struts forth an Ensign.
But for his own Son and Heir my Lord will
purchase a whole troop of Horse: and a
Beardless Boy, that a month agone was
Birched at Eton for flaws in his Grammar,
will Vapour it about on the Mall with a
Queue &agrave; la Rosbach, and a Long Sword
trailing behind him as a full-blown Captain
of Dragoons.</p>

<p>I believe Pinchin's father to have been a
Tailor. There is no harm in the Craft,
honestly exercised; but since the world first
Began nine Tailors have made a Man; and
you cannot well see a knight of the shears
without asking in your own mind where he
has left his Eight brethren. Bartholomew
Pinchin looked like a Tailor, talked like a
Tailor, and thought like a Tailor. Let it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
not, however, be surmised that I have any
mind to Malign the Useful Churls who make
our Clothes. Many a time have I been
beholden to the strong Faith and Generous
Belief of a Tailor when I have stood in need
of new Apparel, and have been under momentary
Famine of Funds for the Payment
thereof. Those who are so ready to sneer
at a Snip, and to cast Cabbage in his teeth,
would do well to remember that there are
Seasons in Life when the Goose (or rather
he that wields it) may save, not only the
Capitol, but the Soldier who stands on Guard
within. How doubly Agonising is Death
when you are in doubt as to whence that
Full Suit of Black needed on the Funeral
Night will arrive! What a tremor comes
over you when you remember that this
Day Week you are to be Married, and
that your Wedding Garment is by no means
a certainty! What a dreadful Shipwreck to
your Fortune menaces you when you are
bidden to wait on a Great Man who has
Places to give away, and you find that your
Velvet Coat shows the Cord! 'Tis in these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Emergencies that the brave Confidence of
the Tailor is distilled over us like the Blessed
Dew from Heaven; for Trust, when it is
really needed, and opportunely comes, is
Real Mercy and a Holy Thing.</p>

<p>About my master's Wealth there was no
doubt. Lord Poddle, although a questionable
cousin of his, would have been glad
to possess his spurious kinsman's acres. I
should put down the young Esquire's income
as at least Twenty Hundred Pounds a year.
His Father had been, it cannot be questioned,
a Warm Man; but I should like to know, if
he was veritably, as his Son essayed to make
out, a Gentleman, how he came to live in
Honey-Lane Market, hard by Cheapside.
Gentlemen don't live in Honey-Lane Market.
'Tis in Bloomsbury, or Soho, or Lincoln's
Inn, or in the parish of St. George,
Hanover Square, that the real Quality have
their habitations. I shall be told next
that Gentlefolks should have their mansions
by the Bun-House at Pimlico, or in the
Purlieus of Tyburn Turnpike. No; 'twas
at the sign of the Sleeveboard, in Honey-Lane<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Market, that our Patrician Squire made
his money. The estate at Hampstead was a
very fair one, lying on the North side, Highgate
way. Mr. Pinchin's Mamma, a Rare
City Dame, had a Life Interest in the property,
and, under the old Gentleman's will,
had a Right to a Whole Sum of Ten Thousand
Pounds if she married again. Thus it
was that young Bartholomew was always in
an agony of Terror to learn that his mamma
had been seen walking on a Sunday afternoon
in Gray's-Inn Gardens, or taking Powdered
Beef and Ratafia at the tavern in Flask
Walk, or drinking of Syllabubs at Bellasise;
and by every post he expected to hear the
dreadful intelligence that Madam Pinchin
had been picked up as a City Fortune by some
ruffling Student of the Inns of Court, some
Irish Captain, or some smart Draper that, on
the strength of a new Periwig and a lacquered
hilt to his Sword, passes for a Macarony.
'Tis not very romantic to relate, but 'tis no
less a fact, that the Son and the Mother
hated one another. You who have gone
through the World and watched it, know
that these sad unnatural loathings between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Parents and Children, after the latter are
grown up, are by no means uncommon. To
me it seems almost impossible that Estrangement
and Dislike&mdash;nay, absolute Aversion&mdash;should
ever engender between the Mother and
the Daughter, that as a Babe hath hung on
her Paps (or should have been so Nurtured,
for too many of our Fashionable Fine Dames
are given to the cruelly Pernicious Practice
of sending their Infants to Nurse almost the
very next Week after they are Born, thus Divorcing
themselves from the Joys of Tender
Affection, and drying up the very Source and
Fontinel of Natural Endearments; from
which I draw the cause of many of the harsh
cold Humours and Uncivil Vapours that do
reign between the Great and their children).
You may cry Haro upon me for a Cynic or
Doggish Philosopher; but I relate my Experiences,
and the Things that have stricken
my Mind and Sense. I do know Ladies of
Quality that hate their Daughters, and would
willingly Whip them, did they dare do so,
Grown Women as they are, for Spite. I do
know Fathers, Men of Parts and Rank, forsooth,
jealous of their Sons, and that have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
kept the Youngsters in the Background, and
even striven to Obscure their Minds that
they might not cross the Paternal Orbit.
And has it not almost passed into a proverb,
that my Lord Duke's Natural and most Inveterate
Enemy is my Lord Marquis, who is
his Heir? But not to the World of Gold
and Purple are these Jealousies and Evil
Feelings confined. You shall find them to
the full as Venomous in hovels, where pewter
Platters are on the shelves, and where Fustian
and Homespun are the only wear.
Down in the West of England, where a
worthy Friend of mine has an Estate, I know
a Shepherd tending his flocks from sunrise&mdash;ay,
and before the Sun gets up&mdash;until sundown.
The honest man has but half-a-dozen
shillings a week, and has begotten Fourteen
Children. He is old now, and feeble, and is
despised by his Progeny. He leads at Home
the sorriest of Lives. They take his wages
from him, and, were it not for a lump of fat
Bacon which my friend's Servants give him
now and again for Charity's sake, he would
have nothing better to eat from Week's End<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to Week's End than the hunch of Bread and
the morsel of Cheese that are doled forth to
him every morning when he goes to his
labour. Only the other day, his sixth
daughter, a comely Piece enough, was Married.
The poor old Shepherd begs a Holiday,
granted to him easily enough, and goes home
at Midday instead of Even, thinking to have
some part in the Wedding Rejoicings, the
which his last week's wages have gone some
way to furnish forth. I promise you that
'tis a fine Family Feast that he comes across.
What but ribs of Beef and Strong Ale&mdash;none
of your Harvest Clink&mdash;and old Cyder
and Plum-pudding galore! But his Family
will have none of his company, and set the
poor old Shepherd apart, giving him but an
extra lump of Bread and Cheese to regale
himself withal. 'Twas he who told the Story
to my Friend, from whom I heard it. What,
think you, was his simple complaint, his sole
Protest against so much Cruelty and Injustice?
He did not rush into the Feasting
Room and curse these Ingrates; he did not
trample on this Brood that he had nurtured,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and that had turned out worse in their Unthankfulness
than Vipers; no, he just sat
apart, wringing of his Hands, and meekly
wailing, "What, a weddin', and narrer a bit
o' puddin'&mdash;narrer a bit, a bit o' puddin'!"
The poor soul had set his head on a slice of
dough with raisins in it, and even this crumb
from their Table was denied him by his Cubs.
'Tis a brave thing, is it not, Neighbour, to be
come to Threescore Years, and to have had
Fruitful Loins, and to be Mocked and Misused
by those thou hast begotten? How
infinitely better do we deem ourselves than
the Cat and Dog, and yet how often do we
imitate those Dumb Beasts in our own degree!
fondling them indeed when they are
Kittens and Puppies, but fighting Tooth and
Nail with them when they be full grown.
But there is as much to be said on the one
side as on the other; and for every poor old
Lear wandering up and down, pursued by
the spite of Goneril and Regan, shall you
find a Cordelia whose heart is broken by her
Sire's Cruelty.</p>

<p>We did not long abide in Ostend. Presently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
my master grew tired of the Town, as
he did of most Things, and longed for change.
He had no better words for the Innkeepers,
Merchants, and others who attended him,
than to call them a parcel of Extortionate
Thieves, and to vow that they were all in a
conspiracy for robbing and bringing him to
the Poor House. He often did us the
honour to accuse us of being in the Plot;
and many a time I felt inclined to resent his
Impertinence, and to cudgel the abusive little
man soundly; but I was wise, and held my
Tongue and my Hand as well. Following
the Chaplain's advice, and humouring this
little Man-monkey in all his caprices, I found
that he was not so bad a master after all, and
that when he was Drunk, which was almost
always, he could be generous enough. When
he was sober and bewailed his excessive Expenditure,
our policy was to be Mum, or
else to Flatter him; and so no bones were
broken, and I was well clad and fed, and always
had a piece of gold in my pouch, and
so began to Feel my Feet.</p>

<p>We visited most of the towns in the Low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Countries, then under the Austrian rule, enjoying
ourselves with but little occasion for
repining. Now our travelling was done on
Horseback, and now, when there was a Canal
Route, by one of those heavy, lumbering,
jovial old boats called Treyckshuyts. I know
not whether I spell the word correctly, for
in the Languages, albeit fluent enough, I
could never be accurate; but of the pleasant
old vessels themselves I shall ever preserve
a lively recollection. You made a bargain
with the Master before starting, giving him
so many guilders for a journey, say between
Ghent and Bruges, the charge amounting
generally to about a Guinea a day for each
Gentleman passenger, and half the sum for
a servant. And the Domestic's place on the
fore-deck and in the fore-cabin was by no
means an unpleasant one; for there he was
sure to meet good store of comely Fraus, and
Jungfraus comelier still, with their clean
white caps, Linsey-woolsey petticoats, wooden
shoes, and little gold crosses about their
necks. Farmers and labouring men and
pedlars, with now and then a fat, smirking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Priest or two, who tried Hard to Convert
you, if by any means he discovered you to
be a Heretic, made up the complement of
passengers forward; but I, as a servant, was
often called aft, and had the pick of both
companies, with but light duties, and faring
always like a Fighting Cock. For no sooner
was our Passage-Money paid than it became
my Duty to lay in a Great Stock of Provisions
for the voyage, my master disdaining
to put up with the ordinary country Fare of
dried fish, salted beef, pickled cabbage, hard-boiled
eggs, faro-Beer, Schiedam, and so
forth, and instructing me, under Mr. Hodge's
direction, to purchase Game, Venison, Fruit,
Vegetables, Preserves, Cheeses, and other
condiments, with a sufficient number of flasks
of choice wine, and a little keg of strong
cordial, for fear of Accidents. And aboard
the Treyckshuyt it was all Singing and
Dancing and Carding and drinking of Toasts.
The quantity of Tobacco that the country
people took was alarming, and the fumes
thereof at first highly displeasing to Mr.
Pinchin; but I, from my sea education, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the Time I had passed in the Western Indies,
was a seasoned vessel as to tobacco; and
often when my Master had gone to his cabin
for the night was permitted to partake of a
Puff on deck with the Reverend Mr. Hodge,
who dearly loved his Pipe of Virginia. The
Chaplain always called me John D.; and indeed
by this time I seemed to be fast losing
the character as well as the name of Dangerous.
My life was passed in the Plenitude
of Fatness; and I may say almost that I was
at Grass with Nebuchadnezzar, and had one
Life with the beasts of the field; for my
days were given up to earthly indulgences,
and I was no better than a stalled ox. But
the old perils and troubles of my career were
only Dormant, and ere long I was to become
Jack Dangerous again.</p>

<p>A year passed away in this eating and
drinking, dozy, lazy kind of life. I was past
seventeen years of age, and it was the autumn
of the year '29. We were resting for a time&mdash;not
that Master, Chaplain, or Man ever
did much to entitle them to repose&mdash;at the
famous watering-place of Spa, close to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
German Frontier. We put up at the Silver
Stag, where we were entertained in very
Handsome Style. Spa, or the Spaw, as it
was sometimes called, was then one of the
most Renowned Baths in Europe, and was
attended by the very Grandest company.
Here, when we arrived, was my Lord Duke
of Tantivy, an English nobleman of the very
Highest Figure, accompanied by my Lady
Duchess, the Lord Marquis of Newmarket,
his Grace's Son and Heir, who made Rare
Work at the gaming tables, with which the
place abounded; the Ladies Kitty and Bell
Jockeymore, his daughters; and attended by
a Numerous and sumptuous suite. Here
also did I see the famous French Prince de
Noisy-Gevres, then somewhat out of favour
at the French Court, for writing of a Lampoon
on one of his Eminence the Cardinal
Minister's Lady Favourites; the Great Muscovite
Boyard Stchigakoff, who had been here
ever since the Czar Peter his master had
honoured the Spaw with his presence; and
any number of Foreign Notabilities, of the
most Illustrious Rank, and of either sex.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Money was the great Master of the Ceremonies,
however, and he who had the Longest
Purse was bidden to the Bravest Entertainments.
The English of Quality, indeed (as
is their custom, which makes 'em so Hated
by Foreigners), kept themselves very much
to themselves, and my Lord Duke of Tantivy's
party, with the exception of the Marquis
of Newmarket, who was good enough
to Borrow a score of gold pieces from us, and
to Rook us at cards now and then, took not
the slightest notice of my poor little Master,
who was dying to be introduced into Polite
Society, and spread abroad those fictions of
his cousinage to Lady Betty Heeltap and my
Lord Poddle everywhere he went; but the
French and German Magnificoes were less
Haughty, and were glad to receive an English
Traveller who, when his Vanity was
concerned, would spend his cash without
stint. We drank a great deal of the Water
of the Spaw, and uncommonly nasty it was,
making it a Thing of vital necessity to take
the Taste of it out of our Mouths as soon as
might be with Wine and Strong Waters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>From the Spaw we went by easy Stages
to Cologne, a dirty, foul-smelling place, but
very Handsome in Buildings, and saw all
that was to be seen, that is to say, the
churches, which Abound Greatly. The
Jesuits' Church is the neatest, and this was
shown us in a very complaisant manner,
although 'tis not the custom to allow Protestants
to enter it. Our Cicerone was a
bouncing young Jesuit, with a Face as Rosy
as the sunny side of a Katherine Pear; but
it shocked me to hear how he indulged in
Drolleries and Raileries in the very edifice
itself. He quizzed both the Magnificence
and Tawdriness of the Altars, the Images of
the Saints, the Rich Framing of the Relics,
and all he came across, seeming no more
impressed by their solemnity than the Verger
Fellow in Westminster Abbey when he
shows the Waxwork to a knot of Yokels at
sixpence a head. "Surely," I thought,
"there must be something wrong in a Faith
whose Professors make so light of its ceremonies,
and turn Buffoons in the very
Temples;" nor could I help murmuring inwardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
at that profusion of Pearls, Diamonds,
and Rubies bestowed on the adornment
of a parcel of old Bones, decayed Teeth,
and dirty Rags. A Fine English Lady, all
paint and Furbelows, who was in the church
with us, honestly owned that she coveted
St. Ursula's great Pearl Necklace, and, says
she, "'Tis no sin, and not coveting one's
neighbour's goods, for neither St. Ursula
nor the Jesuits are any Neighbours of mine;"
and as for my Master, he stared at a Great
St. Christopher, mighty fine in Silver, and
said that it would have looked very well as
an Ornament for a Cistern in his garden at
Hampstead.</p>

<p>From Cologne to Nuremberg was five
days, travelling post from Frankfort; and
here we observed the difference between the
Free Towns of Germany and those under
the government of petty Absolute Princes.
The streets of Nuremberg are well built, and
full of People; the shops are loaded with
Merchandise, and commonly Clean and
Cheerful. In Cologne and Wurtsburg there
was but a sort of shabby finery: a number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of dirty People of Quality sauntered out:
narrow nasty streets out of repair; and
above half of the common Sort asking Alms.
Mr. Hodge, who would have his jest, compared
a Free Town to a handsome, clean
Dutch Burgher's wife, and a Petty Prince's
capital to a poor Town Lady of Pleasure,
painted and ribboned out in her Head-dress,
with tarnished Silver-lace shoes, and a ragged
Under Petticoat&mdash;a miserable mixture of
Vice and Poverty.</p>

<p>Here at Nuremberg they had Sumptuary
Laws, each man and woman being compelled
to dress according to his Degree, and the
Better sort only being licensed to wear
Rich suits of clothes. And, to my thinking
(though the Putting it in Practice might
prove somewhat inconvenient), we should be
much better off in England if some such
laws were made for the moderation and
restraining of Excess and Extravagance in
Apparel. As folks dress nowadays, it is
impossible to tell Base Raff from the Highest
Quality. What with the cheapness of Manufactured
goods, and the pernicious introduction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of imitation Gold and Silver-lace,
you shall find Drapers' apprentices, Tavern
drawers, and Cook wenches, making as brave
a Figure on Sundays as their masters and
mistresses; and many a young Spark has
been brought to the Gallows, and many a
poor Lass to Bridewell or the 'Spital, through
an over Fondness for cheap Finery, and a
crazy conceit for dressing like their betters.</p>

<p>Nuremberg hath its store of Churches
and Relics, and the like; and even the
Lutherans, who are usually thought to be
so strict and severe in the adornment of
their Temples, have in one of 'em a large
Cross fairly set with jewels. But this is
nothing to the Popish High Church, where
they have at least a score of Saints, all
dressed out in laced clothes, and fair
Full-bottomed Wigs, plentifully powdered.
Here did we come across a Prince Bishop of
one of the Electoral German Towns, travelling
with a Mighty Retinue of Canons
and Priests, and Assessors and Secretaries,
and a long train of Mules most richly caparisoned,
with a guard of a hundred Musketeers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
with violet liveries and Mitres
broidered on their cartouch-boxes, to keep
the Prince Bishop from coming to harm.
My Master dined with this Reverend Personage,
although Mr. Hodge, to maintain
the purity of his cloth, kept aloof from any
such Papistical entertainment; but I was of
the party, it being my duty to wait behind
the Squire's chair. We dined at two of the
clock on very rich meats, high spiced, as I
have usually found Princes and Bishops to
like their victuals (for the Plainer sort soon
Pall on their Palates), and after dinner there
was a Carousal, which lasted well nigh till
bed-time. His Episcopal Highness's Master
of the Horse (though the title of Master of
the Mules, on which beasts the company
mostly rode, would have better served him)
got somewhat too Merry on Rhenish about
Dusk, and was carried out to the stable,
where the Palefreneers littered him down
with straw, as though he had been a Horse
or a Mule himself; and then a little fat
Canon, who was the Buffoon or Jack Pudding
of the party, sang songs over his drink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
which were not in the least like unto Hymns
or Canticles, but rather of a most Mundane,
not to say Loose, order of Chant. His
Highness (who wore the Biggest Emerald
ring on his right Forefinger, over his glove,
that ever I saw) took a great fancy to my
Master, and at Parting pledged him in
choice Rhenish in the handsomest fashion,
using for that purpose a Silver Bell holding
at least a Pint and a half English. Out of
this Bell he takes the clapper, and holding
it mouth upwards, drains it to the health of
my Master, then fixes the clapper in again,
Topsy-turvies his goblet, and rings a peal
on the bell to show that he is a right
Skinker. My Master does the same, as in
Duty Bound, and mighty Flustered he got
before the ringing-time came; and then the
little Fat Canon that sang the songs essayed
to do the same, but was in such a Quandary
of Liquor, that he spills a pint over Mr.
Secretary's lace bands, and the two would
have fallen to Fisticuffs but for his Episcopal
Highness (who laughed till his Sides Shook
again) commanding that they should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
separated by the Lacqueys. This was the
most jovial Bishop that I did meet with;
and I have heard that he was a good kind
of man enough to the Poor, and not a harsh
Sovereign to his subjects, especially to the
Female Part who were fortunate enough to
be pretty; but young as I was, and given
to Pleasures, I could not help lifting up my
Hands in shocked Amazement to see this
Roystering kind of life held by a Christian
Prelate. And it is certain that many of
the High Dutch Church Dignitaries were at
this time addicted to a most riotous mode
of living. 'Twas thought no scandal in a
Bishop to Drink, or to Dice, or to gallivant
after Damosels: but woe be to him if he
Dared to Dance, for the Shaking of a Leg
(that had a cassock over it) was held to be
a most Heinous and Unpardonable Sin.</p>

<p>Next to Ratisbon, where Mr. Pinchin
was Laid up with a Fever brought on by
High Living, and for more than Five Weeks
remained between Life and Death, causing
both to Mr. Hodge and myself the Greatest
Anxiety; for, with all his Faults and absurd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Humours, there was something about the
Little Man that made us Bear with him.
And to be in his Service, for all his capricious
and passing Meannesses, was to be
in very Good Quarters indeed. He was
dreadfully frightened at the prospect of
Slipping his Cable in a Foreign Land, and
was accustomed, during the Delirium that
accompanied the Fever, to call most piteously
on his Mamma, sometimes fancying himself
at Hampstead, and sometimes battling with
the Waves in the Agonies of the cramp, as
I first came across him at Ostend. When
he grew better, to our Infinite Relief, the
old fit of Economy came upon him, and he
must needs make up his mind to Diet himself
upon Panada and Mint Tea, taking no
other nourishment, until his Doctor tells
him that if he did not fall to with a Roast
chicken and a flask of White Wine, he would
sink and Die from pure Exhaustion. After
this he began to Pick up a bit, and to Relish
his Victuals; but it was woful to see the
countenance he pulled when the Doctor's
Bill was brought him, and he found that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
had something like Eighty Pounds sterling
to pay for a Sickness of Forty Days. Of
course he swore that he had not had a tithe
of the Draughts and Mixtures that were set
down to him,&mdash;and he had not indeed consumed
them bodily, for the poor little
Wretch would have assuredly Died had he
swallowed a Twentieth Part of the Vile
Messes that the Pill-blistering Gentleman
sent in; but Draughts and Mixtures had all
duly arrived, and we in our Discretion had
uncorked them, and thrown the major part
of their contents out of window. We were
in league forsooth (so he said) with the
Doctor to Eat and Ruin him, and 'twas not
till the latter had threatened to appeal to
the Burgomaster, and to have us all clapped
up in the Town Gaol for roving adventurers
(for they manage things with a High Hand
at Ratisbon), that the convalescent would
consent to Discharge the Pill-blisterer's demands;
and, granting even that all this
Muckwash had been supplied, the Doctor
must have been after all an Extortioner, and
have made a Smart Profit out of that said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Fever; for he presses a compliment of a
silver snuff-box on the Chaplain, giving me
also privately a couple of Golden Ducats;
nor have I any doubt that the Innkeeper
had also his commission to receive for recommending
a Doctor to the sick Englishman,
and was duly satisfied by Meinheer
Bolus.</p>

<p>There was the Innkeeper's bill itself to
be unpouched, and a mighty Pother there
was over each item, Mr. Pinchin seeming to
think that because he had been sick it was
our Duty to have laid abed too, swallowing
nought but Draughts and Slops. Truth
was, that we should not have been Equal to
the task of Nursing and Tending so difficult
a Patient had we not taken Fortifying and
Substantial Nourishment and a sufficiency
of Wholesome Liquor; not making merry
it is true, with indecent revelry, but Bearing
up with a Grave and Reverent countenance,
and taking our Four Meals a day, with Refreshing
Soups between whiles. And I have
always found that the vicinage of a Sick
Room is apt to make one exceeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Hungry and Thirsty, and that a Moribund,
albeit he can take neither Bite nor Sup himself,
is, in his surroundings, the cook's best
Friend, and the Vintner's most bountiful
Patron.</p>

<p>Coming to his health again, Mr. Pinchin
falls nevertheless into a state of Dark Melancholy
and Despondency, talking now of returning
to England and ending his days
there, and now entertaining an even Stranger
Fancy that had come over his capricious
mind. We had nursed him during his sickness
according to the best of our Capacity,
but felt nevertheless the want of some
Woman's hand to help us. Now all the
Maids in the House were mortally afraid of
the Fever, and would not so much as enter
the Sick Man's apartment, much less make
his bed; while, if we had not taken it at
our own Risk to promise the Innkeeper
Double Fees for lodging, the cowardly knave
would have turned us out, Neck and Crop,
and we should have been forced to convey
our poor Sufferer to a common Hospital.
But there was in this City of Ratisbon a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
convent of Pious Ladies who devoted themselves
wholly (and without Fee or Reward
for the most part) to works of Mercy and
Charity; and Mr. Hodge happening to
mention my Master's State to the English
Banker&mdash;one Mr. Sturt, who was a
Romanist, but a very civil kind of man&mdash;he
sends to the convent, and there comes down
forthwith to our Inn a dear Good Nun that
turned out to be the most zealous and
patient Nurse that I have ever met with in
my Travels. She sat up night and day with
the Patient, and could scarcely be persuaded
to take ever so little needful Rest and Refreshment.
When she was not ministering
to the sufferer's wants, she was Praying,
although it did scandalise Mr. Hodge a
little to see her tell her Beads; and when
Mr. Pinchin was well enough to eat his
first slice of chicken, and sip his first beaker
of white wine, she Clapped her Hands for
joy, and sang a little Latin Hymn. When
it came to her dismissal, this Excellent Nun
(the whole of whose Behaviour was most
touchingly Edifying) at first stoutly refused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to accept of any Recompense for her services
(which, truly, no Gold, Silver, or Jewels
could have fitly rewarded); and I am
ashamed to say that my Master, who had
then his Parsimonious Nightcap on, was at
first inclined to take the Good Sister at her
Word. Mr. Hodge, however, showed him
the Gross Ingratitude and Indecorum of
such a proceeding, and, as was usual with
him, he gave way, bellowing, however, like
a Calf when the Chaplain told him that he
could not in Decency do less than present a
sum of Fifty Ducats (making about Forty
Pounds of our Money) to the convent; for
personal or private Guerdon the Nun positively
refused to take. So the Money was
given, to the great delectation of the Sisterhood,
who, I believe, made up their minds
to Sing Masses for the bountiful English
Lord as they called him, whether he desired
it or not.</p>

<p>Sorry am I to have to relate that so
Pleasant and Moving an Incident should
have had anything like a Dark side. But
'tis always thus in the World, and there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
no Rose without a Thorn. My master,
thanks to his Chaplain, and, it may be, likewise
to my own Humble and Respectful
Representations while I was a-dressing of
him in the Morning, had come out of this
convent and sick-nurse affair with Infinite
credit to himself and to the English nation
in general. Everywhere in Ratisbon was
his Liberality applauded; but, alas! the
publicity that was given to his Donation
speedily brought upon us a Plague and
Swarm of Ravenous Locusts and Bloodsuckers.
There were as many convents in
Ratisbon as plums in a Christmas porridge;
there were Nuns of all kinds of orders, many
of whom, I am afraid, no better than they
should be; there were Black Monks and
Gray Monks and Brown Monks and White
Monks, Monks of all the colours of the
Rainbow, for aught I can tell. There were
Canons and Chapters and Priories and
Brotherhoods and Sisterhoods and Ecclesiastical
Hospitals and Priors' Almonries and
Saints' Guilds without end. Never did I
see a larger fry of holy men and women,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
professing to live only for the next world,
but making the very best of this one while
they were in it. A greasy, lazy, worthless
Rabble-Rout they were, making their Religion
a mere Pretext for Mendicancy and
the worst of crimes. For the most part they
were as Ignorant as Irish Hedge Schoolmasters;
but there were those among them
of the Jesuit, Capuchin, and Benedictine
orders; men very subtle and dangerous,
well acquainted with the Languages, and
able to twist you round their Little Fingers
with False Rhetoric and Lying Persuasions.
These Snakes in the grass got about my
poor weak-minded Master, although we, as
True Protestants and Faithful Servants, did
our utmost to keep them out; but if you
closed the Door against 'em, they would
come in at the Keyhole, and if you made
the Window fast, they would slip down the
Chimney; and, with their Pernicious Doctrines,
Begging Petitions, and Fraudulent
Representations, did so Badger, Bait, Beleaguer,
and Bully him, that the poor Man
knew not which Way to Turn. They too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
did much differ in their Theology, and each
order of Friars seemed to hold the strong
opinion that all who wore cowls cut in
another shape than theirs, or shaved their
pates differently, must Infallibly Burn; but
they were of one Mind in tugging at Mr.
Pinchin's Purse-strings, and their cry was
ever that of the Horse-Leech's Three
Daughters&mdash;"Give, give!"</p>

<p>Thus they did extract from him Forty
Crowns in gold for Redeeming out of Slavery
among the Sallee Rovers ten Citizens of
Ratisbon fallen into that doleful captivity;
although I do on my conscience believe that
there were not five native-born men in the
whole city who had ever seen the Salt Sea,
much less a Sallee Rover. Next was a
donation for a petticoat for this Saint, and a
wig for that one; a score of Ducats for a
School, another for an Hospital for Lepers;
until it was Ducats here and Ducats there
all day long. Nor was this the worst; for
my Master began to be Troubled in the
Spirit, and to cry out against the Vanities
of the World, and to sigh after the Blessedness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of a Life passed in Seclusion and Contemplation.</p>

<p>"I'll turn Monk, I will," he cried out
one day; "my Lord Duke of Wharton did
it, and why should not I?"</p>

<p>"Monk, and a Murrain to them and Mercy
to us all!" says Mr. Hodge, quite aghast.
"What new Bee will you put under your
Bonnet next, sir?"</p>

<p>"You're a Heretic," answered Mr. Pinchin.
"An Anglican Heretic, and so is my
knave John here. There's nothing like the
old Faith. There's nothing like Relics.
Didn't I see a prodigious claw set in gold
only yesterday in the Barnabite Church,
and wasn't that the true and undoubted relic
of a Griffin?"</p>

<p>"Was the Griffin a Saint?" asks the
Chaplain humbly.</p>

<p>"What's that to you?" retorts my Master.
"You're a Heretic, you're a Scoffer, an
Infidel! I tell you that I mean to become
a Monk."</p>

<p>"What, and wear peas in your shoes!
nay, go without shoes at all, and leave off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
cutting your toe-nails?" quoth the Chaplain,
much irate. "Forsake washing and the
Thirty-nine Articles! Shave your head and
forswear the Act of Settlement! Wear a
rope girdle and a rosary instead of a handsome
sword with a silver hilt at your side!
Go about begging and bawling of paternosters!
Was it for this that I, a Clergyman
of the Church of England, came abroad with
you to keep you in the True Faith and a
Proper respect for the Protestant Succession?"
Mr. Hodge had quite forgotten the
value of his Patron's favour, and was growing
really angry. In those days men would
really make sacrifices for conscience' sake.</p>

<p>"Hang the Protestant Succession, and
you too!" screams Mr. Pinchin.</p>

<p>"Jacobite, Papist, Warming Pan!" roars
the Chaplain, "I will delate you to the
English Envoy here, and you shall be laid
by the heels as soon as ever you set foot in
England. You shall swing for this, sir!"</p>

<p>"Leave the Room!" yells Mr. Pinchin,
starting up, but trembling in every limb, for
he was hardly yet convalescent of his Fever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't," answers the sturdy Chaplain.
"You wretched rebellious little Ape, I arrest
you in the King's name and Convocation's.
I'll teach you to malign the Act of Settlement,
I will!"</p>

<p>Whenever Mr. Hodge assumed a certain
threatening tone, and began to pluck at his
cassock in a certain manner, Mr. Pinchin
was sure to grow frightened. He was
beginning to look scared, when I, who
remembering my place as a servant had
hitherto said nothing, ventured to interpose.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Pinchin!" I pleaded, "think of
your Mamma in England. Why, it will
break the good lady's heart if you go Romewards,
Sir. Think of your Estate. Think
of your tenants and the Commission of the
Peace, and the duties of a Liveryman of the
City of London."</p>

<p>I knew that I had touched my Master in
a tender part, and anon he began to whimper,
and cry about his Mamma, who, he shrewdly
enough remarked, might cause his Estate to
be sequestrated under the Act against Alienation
of Lands by Popish Recusants, and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
rob the Monks of their prey. And then,
being soothingly addressed by Mr. Hodge,
he admitted that the Friars were for the
greater part Beggars and Thieves; and before
supper-time we obtained an easy permission
from him to drive those Pestilent Gentry
from the doors, and deny him on every occasion
when they should be impudent enough
to seek admission to his presence.</p>

<p>We were no such high Favourites in Ratisbon
after this; and I believe that the
Jesuits denounced us to the Inquisition at
Rome,&mdash;in case we should ever go that way,&mdash;that
the Capuchins cursed us, and the
Benedictines preached against us. The Town
Authorities began also to look upon us with
a cold eye of suspicion; and but for the
sojourn of an English Envoy in Ratisbon
(we had diplomatic agents then all over the
Continent, and very little they did for their
Money save Dance and Intrigue) the Burgomaster
and his Councillors might have gotten
up against us what the French do call <i>une
querelle d'Allemand</i>, which may be a Quarrel
about Any thing, and is a Fashion of Disagreeing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
peculiar to the Germans, who may
take offence at the cock of your Hat or the
cut of your Coat, and make either of them a
State affair. Indeed, I believe that some
Imprudent Expressions, made use of by my
Master on seeing the Horrible Engines of
Torture shown to the curious in the vaults
of the castle, were very nearly being construed
into High Treason by the unfriendly
clerical party, and that an Information by
the Stadt-Assessor was being actually drawn
up against him, when, by much Persuasion
coupled with some degree of gentle Violence,
we got him away from Ratisbon altogether.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE FIFTH.</h2>


<h3>OF THE MANNER IN WHICH I CAME TO THE FAMOUS
CITY OF PARIS.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">From</span> Ratisbon we travelled down the River
Danube, in a very pleasant and agreeable
manner, in a kind of Wooden House
mounted on a flat-bottomed Barge, and not
unlike a Noah's Ark. 'Twas most convenient,
and even handsomely laid out, with
Parlours, and with Drawing-Rooms, and
Kitchens and Stoves, and a broad planked
Promenade over all railed in, and with
Flowering Plants in pots by the sides, quite
like a garden. They are rowed by twelve
men each, and move with an almost Incredible
Celerity, so that in the same day one
can Delight one's Eye with a vast Variety
of Prospects; and within a short space of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
time the Traveller has the diversion of seeing
a populous City adorned with magnificent
Palaces, and the most Romantic Solitudes,
which appear quite Apart from the commerce
of Mankind, the banks of the Danube being
exquisitely disposed into Forests, Mountains,
Vineyards rising in Terraces one above the
other, Fields of Corn and Rye, great Towns,
and Ruins of Ancient Castles. Now for the
first time did I see the Cities of Passau and
of Lintz, famous for the retreat of the Imperial
Court when Vienna was besieged by
the Great Turk, the same that John Sobieski,
King of Poland, timeously Defeated and put
to Rout, to the great shame of the Osmanlis,
and the Everlasting Glory of the Christian
arms.</div>

<p>And now for Vienna. This is the capital
of the German Emperor Kaiser, or C&aelig;sar as
he calls himself, and a mighty mob of under-C&aelig;sars
or Archdukes he has about him. In
my young days the Holy Roman Empire
was a Flourishing concern, and made a great
noise in the world; but now people do begin
to speak somewhat scornfully of it, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
hold it in no very great Account, principally,
I am told, owing to the levelling Principles
of the Emperor Joseph the Second, who, instead
of keeping up the proper State of Despotic
Rule, and filling his Subjects' minds
with a due impression of the Dreadful Awe
of Imperial Majesty, has taken to occupying
himself with the affairs of Mean and common
persons,&mdash;such as Paupers, Debtors, Criminals,
Orphans, Mechanics, and the like,&mdash;quite
turning his back on the Exalted Tradition
of undisputed power, and saying sneeringly,
that he only bore Crown and Sceptre
because Royalty was his Trade. This they
call a Reforming Sovereign; but I cannot
see what good comes out of such wild Humours
and Fancies. It is as though my Lord
Duke were to ask his Running Footmen to
sit down at table with him; beg the Coachman
not to trouble himself about stable-work,
but go wash the carriage-wheels and
currycomb the Horses himself; bid my Lady
Duchess and his Daughters dress themselves
in Dimity Gowns and Mob caps, while Sukey
Mobs and Dorothy Draggletail went off to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the drawing-room in Satin sacks and High-heeled
shoes; and, to cap his Absurdities,
called up all his Tenants to tell them that
henceforth they were to pay no Rent or
Manor Dues at the Court Leet, but to have
their Farms in freehold for ever. No; it is
certain the World cannot go on without Authority,
and that, too, of the Smartest. What
would you think of a ship where the Master
Mariner had no power over his crew, and no
license to put 'em in the Bilboes, or have 'em
up at the gangway to be Drubbed soundly
when they deserved it? And these Reforming
Sovereigns, as they call 'em, are only
making, to my mind, Rods for their own
Backs, and Halters for their own Necks.
Where would the Crown and Majesty be now,
I wonder, if His Blessed Majesty had given
way to the Impudent Demands of Mr. Washington
and the American Rebels?<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>


<p>The Streets of Vienna, when I first visited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
that capital, were very close and narrow&mdash;so
narrow, indeed, that the fine fronts of the
Palaces (which are very Grand) can scarcely
be seen. Many of 'em deserve close observation,
being truly Superb, all built of
Fine White Stone, and excessive high, the
town being much too little for the number
of its inhabitants. But the Builders seem
to have repaired that Misfortune by clapping
one town on the top of another, most of the
Houses being of Five and some of Six
Stories. The Streets being so narrow, the
rooms are all exceeding Dark, and never so
humble a mansion but has half a dozen
families living in it. In the Handsomest
even all Ranks and Conditions are Mingled
together pellmell. You shall find Field-Marshals,
Lieutenants, Aulic Councillors,
and Great Court Ladies divided but by a
thin partition from the cabins of Tailors and
Shoemakers; and few even of the Quality
could afford a House to themselves, or had
more than Two Floors in a House&mdash;one for
their own use, and another for their Domestics.
It was the Dead Season of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
year when we came to this City, and so, at
not so very enormous a rate, we got a suite
of six or eight large rooms all inlaid, the
Doors and Windows richly carved and gilt,
and the Furniture such as is rarely seen but
in the Palaces of Sovereign Princes in other
countries; the Hangings in finest tapestry
of Brussels, prodigious large looking-glasses
in silver frames (in making which they are
exceeding Expert); fine Japan Tables, Beds,
Chairs, Canopies, and Curtains of the richest
Genoa Damask or Velvet, almost covered
with gold lace or embroidery. The whole
made Gay by Pictures, or Great Jars of
Porcelain; in almost every room large lustres
of pure Crystal; and every thing as dirty
as a Secondhand Clothes dealer's booth in
Rag Fair.</p>

<p>We were not much invited out at Vienna,
the very Highest Quality only being admitted
to their company by the Austrians, who are
the very Haughtiest and most exclusive
among the High Dutch, and look upon a
mere untitled Englishman as Nobody (although
he may be of Ten Times better blood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
than their most noble Raggednesses). A
mean sort, for all their finely furnished
palaces, and wearing mighty foul Body
Linen. The first question they ask, when
they Hear that a Stranger desires to be
Presented to them, is, "Is he Born?" The
query having nothing to do with the fact of
his nativity, but meaning (so I have been
told), "Has he five-and-thirty Quarterings
in his Coat-of-Arms?" And if he has but
four-and-thirty (though some of their greatest
nobles have not above Four or Five Hundred
Pounds a year to live on), the Stranger is
held to be no more Born than if he were an
embryo; and the Quality of Vienna takes
no more notice of him than of the Babe
which is unborn.</p>

<p>Truly, it was the Dead Season, and we
could not have gone to many Dinners and
Assemblies, even if the Aristocracy had been
minded to show hospitality towards us.
There were Theatres and Operas, however,
open, which much delighted my Master and
myself (who was privileged to attend him),
although the Reverend Mr. Hodge stayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
away for conscience' sake from such Profane
amusements, comforting himself at home
over a merry Book and a Bottle of Erlauer,
which is an Hungarian wine, very dark and
Rough, but as strong as a Bullock, and an
excellent Stomachic. Nothing more magnificent
than the Operas then performed at
the Gardens of the Favorite, throwing the
Paris and London houses utterly into the
shade, and I have heard that the Habits,
Decorations, and Scene Paintings, cost the
Emperor Thirty Thousand Pound Sterling.
And to think of the millions of poor ragged
wretches that must have been taxed, and
starved, and beaten, and robbed, and skinned
alive, so to speak, before His Majesty's
pleasures would be paid for.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> The Stage in
this Favorite Garden was built over a large
canal, and at the beginning of the Second
Act divided (as in our own Theatre hard by
Sadler's Wells) into Two Parts, discovering
the water, on which there immediately came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
from different parts two little Fleets of gilded
vessels, that gave the impression (though
ludicrously incorrect in their Riggings and
Man&oelig;uvres) of a Sea-fight. The story of
the Opera was, if I remember right, the
Enchantments of Alcina, an entertainment
which gave opportunity for a great Variety
of Machines and changes of the Scene, which
were performed with surprising swiftness.
No House could hold such large Decorations.
But the Ladies all sitting in the open air,
exposed them to much inconvenience; for
there was but one Canopy for the Imperial
Family; and the first night we were there,
a shower of Rain coming on, the Opera was
broken off, and the Company crowded away
in such confusion that we were almost
squeezed to Death.</p>


<p>If their Operas were thus productive of
such Delectable Entertainment (abating the
Rain and crowding), I cannot say much for
their Comedies and Drolls, which were highly
Ridiculous. We went to the German Playhouse,
and saw the Story of Amphytrion
very scurvily represented. Jupiter falls in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
love out of a peep-hole in the clouds in the
beginning, and the end of it was the Birth
of Hercules. It was very pitiful to see Jove,
under the figure of Amphytrion, cheating a
Tailor of a laced coat, and a Banker of a
bag of Money, and a Jew of a Diamond
Ring, with the like rascally Subterfuges;
and Mercury's usage of Sosia was little more
dignified. And the play was interlarded
with very gross expressions and unseemly
gestures, such as in England would not be
tolerated by the Master of the Revels, or
even in France by the Gentleman of the
Chamber having charge over the Theatres,
but at which the Viennese Quality, both
Male and Female, did laugh Heartily and
with much Gusto.</p>

<p>Memorandum. As some of the Manners
then existing have passed away (in this sad
changeful age, when every thing seems
melting away like Cowheel Jelly at a Wedding
Feast), I have set down for those
curious in such matters that the Vienna
Dames were squeezed up in my time in
gowns and gorgets, and had built fabrics of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
gauze on their Heads about a yard high,
consisting of Three or Four Stories, fortified
with numberless yards of heavy Ribbon.
The foundation of this alarming structure
was a thing they called a <i>Bourle</i>, which was
exactly of the same shape and kind&mdash;only
four times Bigger&mdash;as those Rolls which our
Milkmaids make use of to fix their Pails
upon. This machine they covered with their
own hair, with which they mixed a great
deal of False; it being a particular and
Especial Grace with them to have their
Heads too large to go into a moderate-sized
Tub. Their Hair was prodigiously powdered
to conceal the mixture, and so set out with
numerous rows of Bodkins, sticking out
three or four Inches on each side, made of
Diamonds, Pearls, Green, Red, and Yellow
Stones, that it certainly required as much
Art and Experience to carry the load upright
as to dance on May-day with the Garland
that the Dairy Wenches borrow (under good
security) from the Silversmiths in Cranbourne
Alley. Also they had Whalebone
Petticoats, outdoing ours by several yards in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
circumference. Vastly Ridiculous were these
Fashions&mdash;think you not so, good Sir or
Madam, as the case may be? and yet, may I
be shot, but much later in the present century
I have seen such things as hoops,
<i>bourles</i>, tours, and toupees, not one whit
less Ridiculous.</p>

<p>The Empress, a sweet pretty lady, was
perforce obliged to wear this Habit; but
with the other Female Grandees it only
served to increase their natural Ugliness.
Memorandum: that at Court (whither we
went not, being "unborn," but heard a great
deal of it from hearsay) a Game called Quinze
was the Carding most in vogue. Their
drawing-rooms are different from those in
England, no Man Creature entering it but
the old Grand-Master, who comes to announce
to the Empress the arrival of His
Imperial Majesty the C&aelig;sar. Much gravity
and Ceremony at these Receptions, and all
very Formal, but decent. The Empress sits
in a great easy-chair! but the Archduchesses
are ranged on chairs with tall, straight
Backs, but without arms; whilst the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Ladies of the Court (poor things) may stand
on one Leg, or lean against sideboards, to
rest themselves as they choose; but Sit
Down they Dare not. This is the same
Discipline, I believe, that still prevails, and
so I speak of it in the present tense. The
Table is entirely set out, and served by the
Empress's Maids of Honour (who put on
the very dishes and sauces), Twelve young
Ladies of the First Quality, having no Salary,
but their chamber at court (like our Maids
at the Montpelier by Twitnam), where they
live in a kind of Honourable Captivity, not
being suffered to go to the Assemblies of
Public Places in Town, except in compliment
to the wedding of a Sister Maid, whom
the Empress always presents with her picture
set in Diamonds. And yet, for all
their Strict confinement, I have heard fine
Accounts of the goings-on of these noble
Ladies. The first three of them are called
"Ladies of the Key," and wear little golden
keys at their sides. The Dressers are not
at all the figures they pretend to in England,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
being looked upon no otherwise than
as downright Chambermaids.</p>

<p>So much of the State and Grandeur of
Vienna, then the most considerable city in
Germany; though now Berlin, thanks to the
Genius of its Puissant Monarch, has Reared
its head very high. It was, however, my
cruel Fate to see something more of the
Capital of the Holy Roman Empire, and that
too in a form that was of the unpleasantest.
You must know that my Master and the
Chaplain and I (when we had been some
Weeks in town, and through the interest of
the English Bankers had gotten admission
into some Society not quite so exclusive as
the People who wanted to know whether
you were "born") went one afternoon to an
Archery Festival that was held in the garden
of the Archchancellor's Villa, at Sch&ouml;nbrunn
(now Imperial property). 'Twas necessary
to have some kind of Introduction; but
that, if you stood well in the Banker's Books,
was not very Difficult; and, invited or not,
you had to pay a golden Ducat to the Usher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of Ceremonies (a preposterous creature, like
the Jack of Diamonds in his dress), that
brought your ticket to your lodgings. So
away we went to Sch&ouml;nbrunn, and at a Respectful
distance were privileged to behold
two of the young Archduchesses all dressed,
their Hair full of jewels, and with bows and
arrows in their hands; while a little way off
were placed three oval pictures, which were
the marks to be shot at. The first was a
Cupid, filling a bottle of Burgundy, with
the motto "<i>Cowards may be brave here.</i>"
The second Fortune, holding a garland, with
the motto "<i>Venture and Win.</i>" The third
a Sword with a Laurel Wreath at the point,
and for legend, "<i>I can be vanquished without
shame.</i>" At t'other end was a Fine Gilded
Trophy all wreathed with flowers, and made
of little crooks, on which were hung rich
Moorish Kerchiefs (which were much affected
by the Viennese, a people very fond of gay
and lively colours), tippets, ribbons, laces,
&amp;c., for the small prizes. The Empress, who
sat under a splendid canopy fenced about by
musketeers of the Life Guard, gave away the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
first prize with her own hand, which was a
brave Ruby Ring set with Diamonds in
a gold snuff-box. For the Second prize
there was a little Cupid, very nicely done
out of amethysts, and besides these a set of
fine Porcelain, of the kind they call Eggshell
(for its exceeding Tenderness and Brittleness),
with some Japan trunks, feather-fans,
and Whimwams of that order. All
the men of quality in Vienna were spectators;
but only the ladies had permission to
shoot. There was a good background of
burghers and strangers, and in the rear of all
a Mob that drank beer and scrambled for
Kreutzers, which the officers of the Guard who
were keeping the Barriers would now and
then throw among them for their Diversion's
sake. And all behind it was like a
Fair, set out with Booths, where there was
shooting and drinking and Gaming, just at
one's ease; for I have ever found that in
the most Despotic countries the Mobile have
a kind of Rude License accorded them;
whereas in States where there is Freedom
Authority gives a man leave to Think, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
very carefully ties his hands and feet whenever
he has a mind to a Frisk. My Master
was in very good spirits that day (having
quite recovered his health), and for a time
wanders about the Tents, now treating the
common people, and now having a bumper
with Mr. Hodge. We had tickets for the
second ring, but not for the Inner one, where
the Quality were standing; but just before
the shooting of the great Match for the
Empress's ruby ring, Mr. Pinchin, into
whose head some of the bubbles from the
white Hungarian had begun to mount, begins
to brag about his gentle extraction, and
his cousinage to Lady Betty Heeltap and
my Lord Poddle. He vows that he is as
well "born" as any of the rascaille German
Sausage-gorgers (as he calls them), and is as
fit to stand about Royalty as any of them.
The Chaplain, who was always a discreet
man, tried hard to persuade him against
thrusting himself forward where his company
was not desired; but Mr. Pinchin was
in that state in which arguing with a man
makes him more obstinate. Away he goes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the Chaplain prudently withdrawing into a
Booth; but I, as in Duty bound, followed
my Master, to see that he got into no mischief.
But, alas, the Mischief that unhappy
little Man speedily contrived to entangle
himself within!</p>

<p>By dint of a Florin here and a Florin
there, the adventurous Squire succeeded in
slipping through the row of Guards who
separated the outer from the inner Ring,
who, from the richness of his Apparel (for he
was dressed in his very Best), may perhaps
have mistaken him for some Court Nobleman
who had arrived late. He had got
within the charmed circle indeed (I being a
few paces behind him), and was standing on
Tiptoe to take a full stare at one of the young
Archduchesses who was bending her bow to
shoot at Cupid, when up comes an old Lord
with a very long white face like a Sheep, with
a Crimson Ribbon across his breast, and a
long white staff in his hand atop of which
was a Golden Key. He first asks my Master
in German what he wants there, at least so
far as I could understand; to which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Squire, not being versed in the Tongues of
Almaine (and, indeed, High Dutch and Low
Dutch are both very Base Parlance, and I
never could master 'em), answers, "<i>Non comprenny</i>,"
which was his general reply when
he was puzzled in the Foreign Lingos. Then
the old Lord, with a very sharp voice and in
French, tells him that he has no Business
there, and bids him begone. Mr. Pinchin
could understand French, though he spoke
it but indifferently; but he, being fairly
Primed, and in one of his Obstinate Moods,
musters up his best parleyvoo, and tells the
Ancient with the Golden Key (and I saw
that he had another one hung round his neck
by a parcel chain, and conjectured him to
be a High Chamberlain at least) to go to the
Devil. (I ask pardon for this word.) Hereupon
my Lord with the Sheep's countenance
collars him, runs his white stick into his
visage, so that the key nearly puts his eye
out, and roars for the Guard. Then Mr.
Pinchin, according to his custom when he
has gotten himself into a pother, begins to
squeal for Me, and the Chaplain, and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Mamma, to help him out of it. My blood
was up in a moment; I had not had a Tussle
with any one for a long time. "Shall I who
have brained an English Grenadier sneak off
before a rabble-rout of Sauerkraut Soldiers?"
I asked myself, remembering how much
Stronger and Older I had grown since that
night. "Here goes, Jack Dangerous!" and
away I went into the throng, wrenched the
white staff from the old Lord's hand, made
him unhand my Master, and drawing his
Sword for him (he being too terrified to
draw it himself), grasped him firmly by the
arm, and was preparing to cut a way back
for both of us through the crowd. But
'twas a mad attempt. Up came the Guard,
every man of them Six Foot high, and for
all they were Sauerkraut Soldiers, pestilent
Veterans who knew what Fighting meant.
When I saw their fixed Bayonets, and their
Mustachios curling with rage, I remembered
a certain Scar I had left on me after a memorable
night in Charlwood Chase. We were
far from our own country, and there was no
Demijohn of Brandy by; so, though it went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sore against my Stomach, there was no help
for it but to surrender ourselves at once
Prisoners of War. Prisoners of War, forsooth!
They treated us worse than Galley
Slaves. Our hands were bound behind us
with cords, Halters were put about our necks,
and, the Grenadiers prodding us behind with
their bayonets,&mdash;the Dastards, so to prick
Unarmed Men!&mdash;we were conducted in
ignominy through the rascal Crowd, which
made a Grinning, Jeering, Hooting lane for
us to pass to the Guardhouse at the Entrance
of the Gardens. The Officer of the
Guard was at first for having both of us
strapped down to a Bench as a preliminary
measure to receive two hundred Blows
apiece with Willow Rods in the small of
our backs, which is their usual way of commencing
Judicial proceedings, when up comes
the old Lord in a Monstrous Puff and Flurry,
and says that by the Empress's command no
present Harm is to be done us; but that we
are to be removed to the Town Gaol till the
C&aelig;sar's pleasure respecting us shall be known.
Her Majesty, however, forgot to enjoin that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
we were not to be fettered; so the Captain
of the Guard he claps on us the heaviest
Irons that ever Mutineers howled in; and
we, being flung into a kind of Brewer's
Dray, and accompanied by a Strong Guard
of Horse and Foot, were conveyed to
Vienna, and locked up in the Town Gaol.</p>

<p>Luckily Mr. Hodge speedily got wind of
our misfortune, and hied him to the British
Ambassador, who, being fond of a Pleasant
Story, laughed heartily at the recital. He
promised to get my Master off on payment
of a Fine or something of that sort; and as
for me, he was good enough to opine that I
might think myself Lucky if I escaped with
a sound dose of the Bastinado once a week
for three months, and a couple of years or so
in Irons. The Chaplain pleaded for me as
well as for my Master as hard as he could;
and his Excellency frowned and said, that
the Diversions of a Gentleman might run a
little wild sometimes and no harm done, but
that the Insolence of Servants (which was a
growing evil) must be restrained. "At all
events, I'll see what I can do," he condescended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to explain. "Come what may, the
Fellow can't fare very badly for a sound
Beating, and perhaps they will let him off
when he has had cudgelling enough." So
he calls for his Coach, and goes off to
Court.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE SIXTH.</h2>

<h3>OF PARIS (BY THE WAY OF THE PRISON AT VIENNA),
AND OF MY COMING BACK FOR A SEASON TO MY
OWN COUNTRY, WHERE MY MASTER, THE CHAPLAIN,
AND I PART COMPANY.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Fox in the Fable, so my Grannum
(who had a ready Memory for those Tales)
used to tell me, when he first saw the Lion
was half dead with Fright. The Second
View only a little Dashed him with Tremour;
at the Third he durst salute him
Boldly; and at the Fourth Rencounter
Monsieur Reynard steals a Shin Bone of
Beef from under the old Roarer's Nose, and
laughs at his Beard. This Fable came back
to me, as with a Shrug and a Grin (somewhat
of the ruefullest) I found myself again
(and for no Base Action I aver) in a Prison
Hold. I remembered what a dreadful Sickness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and Soul-sinking I had felt when doors
of Oak clamped with Iron had first clanged
upon me; when I first saw the Blessed Sun
made into a Quince Tart by the cross-bars
over his Golden face; when I first heard
that clashing of Gyves together which is
the Death Rattle of a man's Liberty. But
now! Gaols and I were old Acquaintances.
Had I not lain long in the dismal Dungeon
at Aylesbury? Had I not sweltered in the
Hold of a Transport Ship? I was but a
Youth; but I felt myself by this time a
Parcel Philosopher. The first thing a man
should do when he gets into Gaol, is to ask
himself whether there is any chance of his
being Hanged. If he have no Sand Blindness,
or Gossamer dancing of Threepenny
cord before his eyes, why then he had e'en
better eat and drink, and Thank God, and
hope for the Best. "They won't Hang
me," I said cheerfully enough to myself,
when I was well laid up in Limbo. The
Empress is well known to be a merciful
Lady, and will cast the ermine of Mercy
over the Scarlet Robe of Stern Authority.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Perhaps I shall get my Ribs basted. What
of that? Flesh is flesh, and will Heal.
They cannot beat me so sorely as I have
seen done (but never of myself Ordered but
when I was compelled) to Negro Slaves.
If they fine me, my Master must Pay.
Here I am by the Heels, and until I get
out again what use is there in Fretting?
Lady Fortune has played me a scurvy trick;
but may she not to-morrow play as roguish
a one to the Sheepfaced old Chamber Lord
with the golden Key, or any other smart
Pink-an-eye Dandiprat that hangs about
the Court? The Spoke which now is
highest in her Wheel may, when she gives
it the next good Twist, be undermost as
Nock. So I took Courage, and bade Despair
go Swing for a dried Yeoman Sprat as he is.</div>

<p>I being a Servant, and so unjustly accounted
of Base Degree by these Sour-Cabbage
gorging and Sourer-Beer swilling
High Dutch Bed-Pressers, was put into the
Common Ward with the Raff; while my
Master was suffered, on Payment of Fees,
to have better lodgings. Gaolers are Gaolers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
all over the world, and Golden Fetters are
always the lightsomest. We were some
Sixty Rascals (that is to say, Fifty-nine
scoundrels, with one Honest Youth, your
Humble Servant) in the Common Room,
with but one Bed between us; this being,
indeed, but a Raised Wooden Platform, like
that you see in a Soldiers' Guard Room.
They brought us some Straw every day, and
littered us down Dog Fashion, and that was
all we had for Lodging Gear. It mattered
little. There was a Roof to the Gaol that
was weather-tight, and what more could a
Man want?&mdash;until things got better at
least.</p>

<p>Which they speedily did; and neither
Master nor Man came to any very great
harm. 'Twas a near touch, though; and
the safety of Jack Dangerous's bones hung
for days, so I was afterwards told, by the
merest thread. They deliberated long and
earnestly about my case among themselves.
It was even, I believe, brought before the
Aulic Council; but, after about a week's
confinement, and much going to and fro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
between the English Embassador and the
Great ones of the Court, Mr. Pinchin had
signified to him that he might procure his
Enlargement by paying a Fine of Eight
Hundred Florins, which was reckoned remarkably
cheap, considering his outrageous
behaviour at the Shooting match. Some
days longer they thought fit to detain Me;
but My Master, after he regained his liberty,
came to see me once and sometimes twice a
day; and through his and Mr. Hodge's
kindness, I was supplied with as good
Victuals and Drink as I had heretofore been
accustomed to. Indeed, such abundant fare
was there provided for me, that I had
always a superfluity, and I was enabled to
relieve the necessities and fill the bellies of
many poor Miserable Hungry creatures who
otherwise must have starved; for 'twas the
custom of the Crown only to allow their
Captives a few Kreutzers, amounting to
some twopence-farthing a day English, for
their subsistence. The Oldest Prisoner in
the Ward, whom they called Father of the
Room, would on this Bare Pittance take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
tithe and toll, often in a most Extortionate
manner. Then these Gaol birds would fall
to thieving from one another, even as they
slept; and if a man was weak of Arm and
Feeble of Heart, he might go for a week
without touching a doit of his allowance,
and so might Die of Famine, unless he
could manage to beg a little filthy Cabbage
Soup, or a lump of Black Bread, from some
one not wholly without Bowels of Compassion.</p>

<p>But I had not been here more than a
month when the instances of my master at
length prevailed, and I too was Enlarged;
only some Fifty Florins being laid upon me
by way of fine. This mulct was paid perforce
by Mr. Pinchin; for as 'twas through
his mad folly, and no fault of my own, that
I had come to Sorrow, he was in all Justice
and Equity bound to bear me harmless in
the Consequences. He was fain, however,
to make some Demur, and to Complain, in
his usual piteous manner, of being so
amerced.</p>

<p>"Suppose you had been sentenced to Five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Hundred Blows of a Stick, sirrah,"&mdash;'twas
thus he put the case to me, logically enough,&mdash;"would
you have expected me to pay for
thee in carcase, as now I am paying for thee
in Purse?"</p>

<p>"Circumstances alter cases," interposes
Mr. Hodge in my behalf. "Here is luckily
no question of Stripes at all. John may
bless his Stars that he hath gotten off
without a Rib-Roasting; and to your
Worship, after the Tune they have made
you dance to, and the Piper you have paid,
what is this miserable little Fine of Fifty
Florins?" So my Master paid; and Leaving
another Ten Florins for the poor Losels in
the Gaol to drink his health in, we departed
from that place of Durance, thinking ourselves,
and with reason, very well out of it.</p>

<p>Servants are not always so lucky when
they too implicitly obey the behests of
their Masters, or, in a hot fever of Fidelity,
stand up for them in Times of Danger or
Desperate Affrays. Has there not ever
been brought under your notice that famous
French Law Case, of the Court Lady,&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Dame de Liancourt, I think she was called,&mdash;against
whom another Dame had a Spite,
either for her Beauty, or her Wit, or her
Riches' sake? She, riding one day in her
Coach-and-Six by a cross-road, comes upon
the Dame de Liancourt, likewise in her
Coach-and-Six, both ladies having the ordinary
complement of Running Footmen.
My Lady who had a Spite against her of
Liancourt whispers to her Lacqueys; and
these poor Faithful Rogues, too eager to
obey their Mistress's commands, ran to the
other coach-door, pulled out that unlucky
Dame de Liancourt, and then and there inflicted
on her that shameful chastisement
which jealous Venus, as the Poetry books
say, did, once upon a time, order to poor
Psyche; and which, even in our own times,
so I have heard, Madame du Barry, the last
French King's Favourite, did cause Four
Chambermaids to inflict on some Lady about
Versailles with whom she had cause of
Anger. At any rate, the cruel and Disgraceful
thing was done, the Dame sitting
in her coach meanwhile clapping her hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
O! 'twas a scandalous thing. The poor
Dame de Liancourt goes, Burning with Rage
and Shame, to the Chief Town of the Province,
to lodge her complaint. The matter
is brought before the Parliament, and in due
time it goes to Paris, and is heard and re-heard,
the Judges all making a Mighty
to-do about it; and at last, after some two
years and a half's litigation, is settled in this
wise. My Lady pays a Fine and the Costs,
and begs the Dame de Liancourt's pardon.
But what, think you, becomes of the two
poor Lacqueys that had been rash enough
to execute her Revengeful Orders? Why,
at first they are haled about from one gaol
to another for Thirty Months in succession,
and then they are subjected to the question,
Ordinary and Extraordinary&mdash;that is to say,
to the Torture; and at last, when my Lady
is paying her fine of 10,000 livres, I think,
or about Four Hundred Pounds of our
Money, the Judges at Paris pronounce
against these two poor Devils of Footmen,&mdash;that
were as innocent of any Malice in the
Matter as the Babe that is unborn, and only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Did what they were Told,&mdash;that one is to be
Hanged in the Place de Gr&egrave;ve, and the
other banished to the Galleys, there to be
chained to the Oar for life. A fine Encouragement
truly for those who think that, for
good Victuals and a Fine Livery, they are
bound to obey all the Humours and Caprices,
even to the most Unreasonable and most
Arbitrary, of their Masters and Mistresses.</p>

<p>We were in no great Mood, after this
Affair was over, to remain in Vienna. Mr.
Pinchin did at first purpose journeying
through the Province of Styria by Gratz, to
a little town on the sea-coast, called Trieste,&mdash;that
has much grown in importance during
these latter days,&mdash;and so crossing the Gulf
to Venice; but he abandoned this Scheme.
His health was visibly breaking; his Funds,
he said, were running low; he was more
anxious about his Mamma than ever; and
'twas easy to see that he was half-weary and
half-afraid of the Chaplain and Myself, and
that he desired nothing Half so Much as to
get Rid of us Both. So we packed up, and
resumed our Wanderings, but in Retreat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
instead of Advance. We passed, coming
back, through Dresden, where there are
some fine History Pictures, and close to
which the Saxon Elector had set up a great
Factory for the making of painted Pottery
Ware: not after the monstrous Chinese
Fashion, but rather after the Mode practised
with great Success at our own Chelsea. The
manner of making this Pottery was, however,
kept a high State Secret by the government
of the then Saxon Elector; and no
strangers were, on any pretence, admitted
to the place where the Works were carried
on; so of this we saw nothing: and not
Sorry was I of the privation, being utterly
Wearied and palled with much gadding
about and Sight-seeing. So post to Frankfort,
where there were a many Jews; and
thence to Mayence; and from thence down
the grand old River Rhine to the City of
Cologne; whence, by the most lagging stages
I did ever know, to Bruxelles. But we
stayed not here to see the sights&mdash;not even
the droll little statue of the Mannikin (at
the corner of a street, in a most improper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
attitude; and there is a Group quite as unseemly
in one of the Markets, so I was told,
although at that time we were fain to pass
them by), which Mannikin the burgesses of
Bruxelles regard as a kind of tutelary Divinity,
and set much greater store by than do
we by our London Stone, or Little Naked
Boy in Panyer Alley. But it is curious
to mark what strange fanteagues these
Foreigners run mad after.</p>

<p>At Bruxelles my Master buys an old Post
Carriage&mdash;cost him Two Hundred and Fifty
Livres, which was not dear; and the wretched
horses of the country being harnessed thereto,
we made Paris in about a week afterwards.
We alighted at a decent enough kind of Inn,
in the Place named after Lewis the Great
(an eight-sided space, and the houses handsome,
though not so large as Golden Square).
There was a great sight the day after our
coming, which we could not well avoid seeing.
This was the Burial of a certain great
nobleman, a Duke and Marshal of France,
and at the time of his Decease Governor of
the City of Paris. I have forgotten his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
name; but it does not so much matter at
this time of day, his Grace and Governorship
being as dead as Queen Anne. It began
(the Burial), on foot, from his house, which
was next door but one to our Inn, and went
first to his Parish Church, and thence, in
coaches, right to the other end of Paris, to
a Monastery where his Lordship's Family
Vault was. There was a prodigious long
procession of Flambeaux; Friars, white,
black, and gray, very trumpery, and marvellous
foul-looking; no plumes, banners,
scutcheons, led horses, or open chariots,&mdash;altogether
most mean obsequies. The march
began at eight in the evening, and did not
end till four o'clock the next morning, for
at each church they passed they stopped for
a Hymn and Holy Water. And, by the
way, we were told that one of these same
choice Friars, who had been set to watching
the body while it lay in state, fell asleep one
night, and let the Tapers catch fire of the
rich Velvet Mantle, lined with Ermine and
powdered over with gold Flower-de-Luces,
which melted all the candles, and burnt off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
one of the feet of the Departed, before it
wakened the watcher.</p>

<p>It was afterwards my fortune to know
Paris very well; but I cannot say that I
thought much of the place on first coming
to it. Dirt there was everywhere, and the
most villanous smells that could be imagined.
A great deal of Show, but a vein of
Rascal manners running through it all.
Nothing neat or handsomely ordered. Where
my Master stood to see the Burial Procession,
the balcony was hung with Crimson
Damask and Gold; but the windows behind
him were patched in half-a-dozen places with
oiled paper. At Dinner they gave you at
least Three Courses; but a third of the Repast
was patched up with Sallets, Butter,
Puff-paste, or some such miscarriages of
Dishes. Nothing like good, wholesome,
substantial Belly-Timber. None but Germans,
and other Strangers, wore fine clothes;
the French people mainly in rags, but powdered
up to their eyebrows. Their coaches
miserably horsed, and rope-harnessed; yet,
in the way of Allegories on the panels, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
tawdry enough for the Wedding of Cupid
and Psyche. Their shop-signs extremely
laughable. Here some living at the Y Gue;
some at Venus's Toilette; and others at the
Sucking Cat. Their notions of Honour most
preposterous. It was thought mighty dishonourable
for any that was a Born Gentleman
not to be in the Army, or in the King's
Service, but no dishonour at all to keep
Public Gaming Houses; there being at least
five hundred persons of the first Quality in
Paris living by it. You might go to their
Houses at all Hours of the Night, and find
Hazard, Pharaoh, &amp;c. The men who kept
the gaming-tables at the Duke of Gesvres'
paid him twelve guineas a night for the privilege.
Even the Princesses of the Blood
were mean enough to go snacks in the profits
of the banks kept in their palaces. I
will say nothing more of Paris in this place,
save that it was the fashion of the Ladies
to wear Red Hair of a very deep hue; these
said Princesses of the Blood being consumedly
carroty. And I do think that if a
Princess of the Blood was born with a Tail,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and chose to show it, tied up with Pea-Green
Ribbon, through the Placket-hole of her
Gown, the Ladies, not only in France, but
all over the World, would be proud to sport
Tails with Pea-Green Ribbons,&mdash;or any other
colour that was the mode,&mdash;whether they
were Born with 'em or not.</p>

<p>Nothing more that is worthy of Mention
took place until our leaving Paris. We came
away in a calash, that is, my Master and the
Chaplain, riding at their Ease in that vehicle,
while I trotted behind on a little Bidet, and
posted it through St. Denis to Beauvais. So
on to Abbeville, where they had the Impudence
to charge us Ten Livres for three
Dishes of Coffee, and some of the nastiest
Eau de Vie that ever I tasted; excusing
themselves, the Rogues, on the score that
Englishmen were scarce nowadays. And to
our great Relief, we at last arrived at Calais,
where we had comfortable Lodgings, and
good fare, at a not too exorbitant rate. Here
we had to wait four days for a favourable
Wind; and even then we found the Packet
Boat all taken up for Passengers, and not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
place on board to be had either for Love or
Money. As Mr. Pinchin was desperately
pressed to reach his Native Land, to wait for
the next boat seemed utterly intolerable to
him; so, all in a Hurry, and being cheated,
as folks when they are in a Hurry must
needs be, we bargained for a Private Yatch
to take us to Dover. The Master would
hear of nothing less than five-and-twenty
guineas for the voyage, which, with many
Sighs and almost Weeping, my poor Little
Master agrees to give. He might have recouped
himself ten guineas of the money;
for there was a Great Italian Singing Woman,
with her Chambermaid, her Valet de Chambre,
a Black Boy, and a Monkey, bound for
the King's Opera House in the Haymarket,
very anxious to reach England, and willing
to pay Handsomely&mdash;out of English pockets
in the long-run&mdash;for the accommodation we
had to give; but my capricious Master flies
into a Tiff, and vows that he will have no
Foreign Squallers on board his Yatch with
him. So the poor Signora&mdash;who was not at
all a Bad-looking woman, although mighty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Brown of visage&mdash;was fain to wait for the
next Packet; and we went off in very great
state, but still having to Pay with needless
heaviness for our Whistle. And, of course,
all the way there was nothing but whining
and grumbling on his Worship's part, that
so short a trip should have cost him Twenty-five
Guineas. The little Brute was never
satisfied; and when I remembered the Life
I had led with him, despite abundant Victuals,
good Clothes, and decent Wages, I
confess that I felt half-inclined to pitch him
over the Taffrail, and make an End of him,
for good and all.</p>

<p>The villanous Tub which the Rascals who
manned it called a Yatch was not Seaworthy,
wouldn't answer her Helm, and floundered
about in the Trough of the Sea for a day
and a half; and even then we did not make
Dover, but were obliged to beat up for
Ramsgate. We had been fools enough to
pay the Fare beforehand; and these Channel
Pirates were unconscionable enough to demand
Ten Guineas more, swearing that they
would have us up before the Mayor&mdash;who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
I believe, was in league with 'em&mdash;if we did
not disburse. Then the Master of the Port
came upon us for Dues and Light Tolls;
and a Revenue Pink boarded us, the Crew
getting Half-drunk at our Expense, under
pretence of searching for contraband, and
sticking to us till we had given the Midshipman
a guinea, and another guinea to the
Crew, to drink our Healths.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE SEVENTH.</h2>

<h3>OF CERTAIN TICKLISH UPS AND DOWNS IN MY LIFE:
AMONGST OTHERS OF MY BEING PRESSED FOR SERVICE
IN THE FLEET.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> best of Friends, says the Proverb, must
part, and so must the worst, or the most
indifferent of companions. By this time, I
apprehend,&mdash;that is to say, the year 1728,
Messieurs Pinchin, Hodge, and Dangerous
had had quite enough of each other's company,
and 'twas ripe Time for 'em to Part.
Not but what there were some difficulties
in the way. 'Twas not to be denied that
my little Master was a parcel curmudgeon,
very vain and conceited, very difficult of
management in his Everlasting Tempers,
and a trifle Mad, besides; but his service&mdash;apart
from the inconvenience of bearing
with a tetchy, half Lunatic Ape of Quality,
was light and easy; the victuals were abundant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and the Wages were comfortable. There
must be two parties to make a quarrel, and
when Master and servant propose to part,
there should be a perfect agreement between
them as to the manner of their going
asunder. A Hundred times, vexed by the
follies and exactions of the little man, I had
sworn that I would doff his livery, and have
nothing more to do with him; but then came
the Reflection of the certain Bite and Sup,
and I withheld my abandonment of Service.
It may be that the Chaplain, Mr. Hodge,
was very much of the same mind as your
Humble. He said often, that he had been
bearleader quite long enough to this young
Cub, and was sick alike of his savage hugs,
and uncouth gestures, when he had a mind
to dance. Yet was he wise enough in his
generation to acknowledge the commodity
of a fat Pasty and a full Flask every day in
the year, and of a neverfailing crown piece
in the pouch in the morning for a draught
to cool one's throat, when the bottle had
been pushed about pretty briskly overnight.
Parson Hodge was a philosopher.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
"I don't like the kicks," quoth he; "but
when halfpence come along with 'em, they
cease to be intolerable."</div>

<p>However, all our nice weighings of Pros
and Cons were brought to a very abrupt
standstill upon our arrival at Dover (having
taken a post chariot from Ramsgate) by the
Inconceivable Behaviour of Mr. Pinchin.
This young Gentleman, utterly forgetting
the claims of Duty, of Honour, of Honesty,
and of Gratitude, fairly Ran away from us,
his faithful and Attached Domestics. Without
with your leave or by your leave he
showed us a clean pair of Heels. He left
a very cool Letter for the Chaplain in the
hands of the master of the Inn where we
put up, in which he repeated his old uncivil
Accusation, that we had eaten him out of
House and Home, that we were Leeches,
Pirates, bloodsucking vampires, and the like&mdash;myself
he even did the honour to call a
Designing Cockatrice&mdash;and that he had fled
from us to save the small remains of his
Fortune from being Devoured, and intended
to rejoin his long-neglected Mamma. Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Hodge read me this letter with a very long
face, and asked me what I intended to do.
I answered that I should be better able to
tell him when he had read me the Postscript
to the letter, for that I hardly fancied that
Squire Pinchin would behave in so Base and
Mean a manner as to run away without
paying his Body Servant's wages. Upon
this the Reverend Gentleman hems and ha's
somewhat, and gave me to understand that
Mr. Pinchin had enclosed a draft upon a
Goldsmith in Change Alley in part disbursement
of his debt to him, Mr. Hodge, and
that out of that&mdash;although no special provision
had been made for me by Mr. Pinchin&mdash;he
thought he could spare me a matter of
Ten Pound. Now as he kept the letter very
tight in his hand, and was, withal, a Strong
Man, who would have resisted any attempt
of mine to wrest it from him, I was fain to
take his statement for granted, and in a very
Sulky manner agreed to accept the Ten
Pound in full of all demands, stipulating
only that my Travelling charges to London
should be defrayed. This Mr. Hodge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
boggled at for awhile; but, seeing me Resolute
he gave way, and at last said that there
was no need for me to trouble with going
to the Goldsmith in London to get the Draft
changed&mdash;"If, indeed," says he, "the unhappy
young spendthrift be not proclaimed
a Bankrupt before I get this slip of paper
cashed;" and that having a small store of
Gold by him, he would give me the Ten
Pound down, together with a couple of
Pieces to bear my Expenses to the Town.
To this I agreed; and his Reverence handing
me over the ready, we cried Quits.</p>

<p>"And now, Sir," says I, "as you are no
longer a Led-Parson, and I am no longer a
Lacquey, we are both, till we get Fresh
Places, Gentlemen at large, and Jack is as
good as his Master, I shall be happy to
crack a bottle of Lisbon with you, and
whether you pay or I pay shall be decided
by the flinging up of a Jacobus."</p>

<p>He declared that I was an Impudent
young Fellow, with more Wickednesses in
my Heart than I had hairs in my Head;
but he accepted my Invitation to crack the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
bottle of Lisbon very readily, and won the
Toss of me with much Affability. So, after
a joyous Rouse (which my young Head could
then stand, but I am a sad Skinker at the
bottle now), the Landlord standing in, we
drank Mr. Pinchin's health and better
manners to him; and his Reverence dismissed
me with a Buss and his Benediction.</p>

<p>"When you reach London, which is a
wicked place," says he; "I prithee get you
to Highgate, and without more ado cause
yourself to be sworn upon the Horns there,
never to drink Small Ale when you can get
Strong, and never to Kiss the Maid when
you can Kiss the Mistress. After that, with
your Face, and your Figure, and your
Foreign Travel, to say nothing of your
Amazing Impudence, and your Incorrigible
habit of Lying, I think you will do pretty
well. Go thy ways, my son, and if ever you
come to be hanged, send for Parson Hodge,
and he will (with the Ordinary's permission)
do everything for you in the cart that a True
Blue Church and State Man can wish. <i>Vale:</i>
that is to say, get off, you vagabond," with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
which in his merry way he half pushes me
out of the room at the Inn, and I dare say
that he had given a sufficiently liberal construction
to Mr. Pinchin's postscript as to
cheat me out of Twenty Pound.</p>

<p>And now on this worthy I must bestow
a brace of Paragraphs ere I dismiss him
for good and all, premising that the knowledge
of what I am about to set down
did not come upon me at this period of my
History, but was gathered up, in Odds and
Ends in subsequent epochs of my career:&mdash;some
of it, indeed, many years afterwards.
Parson Hodge had managed&mdash;all losses
allowed for&mdash;to feather his nest pretty well
out of his attendance on Squire Bartholomew
Pinchin, and the ten or twelve pound he
doled out to me (whether the story about
the draft on the Goldsmith was a Cock and
Bull one or not) must have been but a mere
fleabite to him. I heard that he went down
to the Bath, and dropping his Clerical
Dignity for awhile, set up for a fashionable
Physician of High Dutch extraction that
was to cure all ailments. Doctor Von<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Hoogius I think he called himself; and his
travelling about with my little Master had
given him just such a smattering of Tongues
as to enable him to speak Broken English
with just so much of a foreign accent as to
make it unlike a Brogue or a Burr. The
guineas came in pretty quickly, and I believe
that he cured several people of the
Quinsy with pills made of dough, hogslard,
cinnamon, and turmeric, and that he was
highly successful in ridding ladies of fashion
of the vapours by means of his Royal
Arabian Electuary, which was nothing more
than white Jamaica Rum coloured pink and
with a flavouring of Almonds. The regular
Practitioners, however, grew jealous of him,
and beginning to ask him impertinent questions
about his Diploma, he was fain to give
up Legitimate practice, and to pick up a
dirty Living as a mere Quack, and Vendor
of Pills, Potions, Salves, Balsams, and
Elixirs of Life. Then he came down in the
world, owing to a Waiting Gentlewoman
whose fortune he must needs tell, and whom,
'tis said, he cozened out of three quarters'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
wages; so, for fear of being committed by
the justices as a Rogue and Vagabond, he
then kept a Herb Shop for some time, with
great success, until he got into trouble about
a Horse, and being clearly Tart of that
crime, very wisely shifted his quarters to the
Kingdom of Ireland. I have heard that by
turns he was, in his New Sphere, a Player
at the Dublin Theatre, a Drawer at a Usquebaugh
Shop in Cork, a hedge-schoolmaster
among the Bogtrotters&mdash;a wild, savage kind
of People, that infest the Southern parts of
that fertile but distracted kingdom&mdash;a
teacher of the Mathematics in Belfast, and
a fiddler going about to wakes and weddings
in the county of Galway. 'Twas whilst
pursuing this last and jovial vocation that
he was fortunate enough to run away with
an Heiress of considerable Fortune. He
managed it by a sort of Rough and Ready
process they call over there an Abduction,
two or three of the Wild Irishes being killed
while he was getting the young lady on the
car to take her away to be married; and she,
happening to be a Ward in Chancery, he fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
into Contempt, and was committed to Newgate
in the City of Dublin, where he might
have lain till his heels rotted off, but for the
Favourable Renown into which he grew by
his Bold and Gallant Feat of Abduction,
and which brought him into such sympathetic
notice, that interest was made with
the Chancellor to purge him of his contempt,
and he was honourably Discharged
therefrom by means of escaping from Newgate
at night by means of a Silver Key
agreed upon betwixt him and the Warden.
By the way, he had the sagacity at this time
to conceal his being an Englishman, and
passed very easily by the name of O'Hagan.
A subscription was made for him among the
Quality after his Enlargement, and he was
charitably advised to push his fortune among
the Saxons in England, his good friends
little suspecting that he had already pushed
his Fortune there, at different times, to a
very pretty tune. But for his unfortunate&mdash;or
rather fortunate, for him&mdash;collision
with justice, he might have obtained employment
as a Tithe Proctor with some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
dignified and non-resident Established Clergy
in Ireland, who were very anxious to have
able and Unscrupulous Men to collect their
Dues for 'em; but the Sister Isle being, on
several accounts, too hot for Mr. Hodge, Von
Hoogius, O'Hagan, he took shipping with a
purse full of guineas, collected for him by
his kind friends, for Liverpool in Lancashire.
Here he prospered indifferently for a
time, now as a Schoolmaster, now as a
Quack Doctor, under his old High Dutch
alias, and now as an Agent for the crimping
of children for the West India plantations,
which last traffic I have ever held, for reasons
personal, to be utterly Indefensible and
Abominable. A Bill of Indictment before
the Grand Jury speedily, however, put an
end to the chaplain's dealings in flesh and
blood; so he made what haste he could to
town, where squandering what means he
had with him in Riot and Unthrift, and
being unluckily recognised by an old acquaintance
in the Tailoring line, he was
arrested on civil process, and clapped into
the Fleet Prison. But here his ever-soaring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
genius took a new Flight. Those half surreptitious
and wholly scandalous Nuptials
known as Fleet Marriages, were then very
rife, and the adventurer had wit enough to
discover that it was to his interest to resume
his cassock and bands, and to become the
Reverend Mr. Hodge once more. Not
much was wanted to set him up in business.
Canonicals were to be had cheap enough in
Rag Fair for the sending for 'em; a greasy
Common Prayer Book and a chandler's-shop
ledger to serve as a Register, did not cost
much; so with these, and an inimitably
Brazen face, behold our worthy equipped as
a perfect Fleet Parson. He had to maintain
at first a ragged regiment of cads and
Runners to tout for him and bring him
customers, but he soon became notorious,
and formed a very fine connexion. Judgements
by the score had been obtained, and
Detainers lodged against him at the gate,
since his incarceration at the suit of his
acquaintance, the Tailor; but 'twas not long
ere he contrived, by the easy process of
joining people's hands, to gain enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
pay all the claims against him, and by permission
of the Warden of the Fleet, to set
up a Chapel and Liquor Shop within the
rules of the prison. Punch, Geneva, poisonous
wine, brandy, bitters, Rum, and Tobacco,
were sold below stairs, and the Order for the
Solemnization of Matrimony was performed
on the first floor. It became quite a fashionable
thing to go and be married by Parson
Hodge, and at last it would be said of him,
that if he extorted money from you beforehand,
he did not pick your pocket afterwards,
as too many of the Fleet Parsons in
those shameful days were in the habit of
doing. He continued at this merry game
for many years, being in his way quite as
popular as Orator Henley, and coining a
great deal more money than that crack-brained
Fanatic&mdash;for I have always been at
pains to discover whether Henley was more
Rogue or Fool&mdash;till at last his lucrative but
unholy trade was put an end to by an Act
of Parliament, called for by the righteous
indignation of all peaceable and loyal subjects
of the King, who did not desire to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
married in haste and to repent at leisure. I
believe that Parson Hodge retired with a
comfortable fortune, and, going down into
Somersetshire, purchased a small estate there,
and died, much respected, in the odour of many
pigs, and in the Commission of the Peace.</p>

<p>As for poor little Bartholomew Pinchin,
his career was not nearly so prosperous, nor
his end so happy. You will learn, a little
further on, what scurvy tricks Fortune
played him, and how at last his poor little
brains succumbed to the rough toasting of
that graceless jade. I had always thought
him Mad, and Mad, indeed, as a March hare
he proved to be in the long run.</p>

<p>And now as to Myself, for it is surely
fitting that a proper young Fellow, such as
I was now, stout and vigorous, and going
for nineteen years of age, should no longer
remain in the Background. First I hied me
to London by the waggon, where, after four
days' journey&mdash;for it was ill travelling in
those days, between London and Dover&mdash;I
arrived without any misadventure. I was
my own Master, I had Ten Pound in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
pocket (the two additional Pieces being now
spent), and I did not know one single soul
in a city of eight hundred thousand inhabitants.
Is it to be wondered at, under
these premises, that before I fixed upon any
decided line of life, I went, first of all, to the
Deuce. It took me but a woundily short
time to reach that Goal. For ten pounds
you may reckon, we will say&mdash;if you put up
at a small alehouse in the Borough&mdash;upon
about ten friends who shall be very fond of
you for a couple of days. I think, at the
beginning of the third, I had just three and
sixpence left wherewith to buy a razor to cut
my throat withal. "Stuff and nonsense!"
cried the last of the fleeting friends who had
abided with me. "Three and sixpence for
a razor, forsooth! why, a yard of good new
cord, quite strong enough to bear your
weight, can be bought in any shop in
Tooley-street for a penny. You have just
three and fivepence left, brother, to make
yourself merry for the day, and, please the
pigs, we will be merry as grigs upon it until
Sundown (for I took a fancy to you the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
minute I set eyes upon you), and even then
there are two ways out of the hobble,
without twisting your weasand. I have a
pair of pistols, and as I love you like a
brother, will share anything with you; and
we will pad the hoof betwixt this and Deptford,
and see whether we can meet any fat
Kentish hop-grower on his way to the
Borough Market with more money than wit&mdash;a
capital plan, any way, seeing that if you
fail, the Sheriff will hang you for nothing,
and you can keep your penny for drink, or
else you can list for a soldier, as many a tall
and pretty fellow in the like straits has
done before."</p>

<p>I civilly declined this amicable and philosophical
advice, for it had suddenly become
apparent to me that my new friend was a
confirmed Rogue. For opening of the Eyes
there is nothing like having spent all your
money. I gave him a shilling, however, out
of my three and sixpence, and crossed
London Bridge to see if I could find better
luck on the Middlesex side, determined, if
nothing offered itself during the day, to ask<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
my way to the Barracks at the Savoy and
list for a Soldier. I amused myself as I
walked, with the thought that chance might
so bring it about for the Sergeant who would
give me the King's shilling to be the selfsame
grenadier whose sconce I had broken
years agone in Charlwood Chase with the
Demijohn of Brandy.</p>

<p>I had heard, as most Ignoramuses have
done, I suppose, that London Streets are
paved with Gold; and I found 'em as
Muddy, as Stony, and as Hardhearted as I
dare say they have been discovered by ten
thousand Ignoramuses before my time to
be. I was quite dazed and stupified with
the noise and uproar of the Great City, the
more perplexing to me as I was not only a
Stranger, but almost a Foreigner and Outlandish
Man in Great Britain. I could speak
my own tongue well enough with Parson
Hodge and Mr. Pinchin, but when it came
to be clamoured all around me by innumerable
voices, I a'most lost heart, and gave up
the notion that I was an Englishman at all.
It must be confessed, that half a century<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
since we English were a very Blackguard
People, and that London was about the most
disreputable city in all Europe. There were
few public buildings of any great note or
of Majestic Proportions, save St. Paul's
Cathedral, the Monument, and the Banqueting
House at Whitehall. The Mansion
House and the Bank of England were not
yet built, and between them and the Royal
Exchange (the which, noble enough in itself,
was girt about, and choked up with Shops
and Tenements exceeding mean and shabby),
was a nasty, rubbishing, faint-smelling place,
full of fruiterers and herbalists, called the
Stocks Market. The crazy and rotten City
Gates blocked up the chief thoroughfares,
and across the bottom of Ludgate Hill
yawned a marvellous foul and filthy open
sewer, rich in dead dogs and cats, called the
Fleet Ditch. This street was fair enough,
and full of commodious houses and wealthy
shops, but all about Temple Bar was a vile
and horrid labyrinth of lanes and alleys, the
chief and the most villanous of which was a
place full of tripe shops and low taverns,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
called Butcher Row, leading from the Bar
down to the Churchyard of St. Clement's
Danes. The Strand was broad and fair
enough to view as far as the New Exchange;
but in lieu of that magnificent structure
which Sir William Chambers, the Swedish
architect, has built for Government offices,
and where the Royal Academy of Arts and
the Learned Societies have their apartments
(when I first came to town there was no
Royal Academy at all, only a Mean School
for painting from the Life and drawing from
Bustos in St. Martin's Lane; the Royal Society
held their sittings in a court off Fleet
Street; the College of Physicians was chock-a-block
among the butchers in Warwick
Lane, Newgate Market, where it still, to the
scandal of Science, remains; and Surgeon's
Hall, where malefactors were anatomised
after execution&mdash;a Sanguinary but Salutary
custom&mdash;was in the Old Bailey, over against
the leads of the Sessions House)&mdash;in place,
then, of what we now call Somerset House,
albeit it has lost all connexion with the proud
Duke of that name, there stood the Old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Palace of the Queens of England, a remarkable
tumbledown barn of a place,
hideous in its ugliness towards the Strand,
but having some stately edifices at the back,
built by that Famous Engineer, Mr. Inigo
Jones. Here sometimes Queens were lodged,
and sometimes Embassadors&mdash;'twas the
Venetian Envoy, I think, that had his rooms
in Somerset House when I first knew it,&mdash;and
sometimes Masquerades were given. A
company of Soldiers was kept on guard in
the precincts, not so much for ornament as
for use, for they had hard work every night
in the week in quelling the pottle-pot brawls
and brabbling among the Rogues, Thieves,
Besognosos, Beggars, Ribbibes, Bidstands,
and Clapper-dudgeons, male and female, who
infested the outskirts of the Old Palace, or
had Impudently Squatted within its very
walls, and had made of the Place a very
Alsatia, now that Scamp's Paradise in
Whitefriars had been put down by Act of
Parliament. Here they burrowed like so
many Grice, till the shoulder-tapping
Pilchers of the Compter came a badger-drawing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
with their bludgeons. 'Twas a perfect
chaos of clap-dishes, skeldering, cranion-legged
Impostors, fittous cripples, and
gambling bullies, for ever roaring over Post
and Pair, or Dust Point, or throwing their
Highmen, or barbing gold, or yelling profane
songs and catches. A man was killed
here about every other day in some Callet
and Cockoloch squabble, and there was a
broil about twice in every hour. Of course
there were Patricos here, who only wanted
Fashionable Encouragement to rival the
Feet Parsons in the trade of faggot-weddings.
There were philosophers who devised
schemes for paying off the National Debt,
or for making roast ribs of beef out of
brickbats. Here were swept the last pillings
and frayings of the South Sea Bubble, in the
shape of divers Speculators and Directors
who had absconded from their Creditors, and
were here pretty safe from arrest, for although
not legally a sanctuary, it was as
chancy to cop a man here on a capias as
to put one's naked hand into a bag full
of rats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>I dined this day at a sixpenny ordinary in
the New Exchange, and after that asked my
way to the Savoy, which I found to be close
by. So I walked down to the old Tower,
and passed the time of day to the Sergeant
of the Guard, who was for having me empty
a can of ale with him on the spot, but I
would not then, and concealed my intention,
being minded to defer the execution of it
till sunset. I don't know what Vain and
Foolish Hope possessed me that something
might yet turn up which might save me from
the sad necessity of listing for a soldier, to
the which vocation, mindful of my early experiences
among the Blacks in Charlwood
Chase, I entertained a very sincere Abhorrence.
So I wandered up and down the
Streets, asking from time to time where I was,
and being (as is usual with the People of
England in their intercourse with strangers)
cursed or laughed at for a fool or a bumpkin.
Half a dozen times I felt that some rogue
was trying my pocket; but I knew I had no
money to be robbed of, and kept my kerchief
in my hat; only the bare endeavour made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
me mad, and the next time one of my gentleman
nick-skins made a dive into my
pouch, I turned round and hit him a crack
over the head with a short knobbed-stick I
carried, which, I warrant, made him repent
of his Temerity.</p>

<p>I had gotten into St. James's Park about
four o'clock in the afternoon, and was walking
very moodily by the side of the long
water trench called Rosamond's Pond, when
at once a desire seized hold of me to behold
the Tower of London. Whether in my fantastic
Imagination I deemed that I might
find Tower Hill paved with gold, or pick
up some Profitable Acquaintance there, it is
fruitless as this distance of time to inquire.
But I must needs see the Tower, and was as
eager for a view of that famous Fortress as
though I had been the veriest holiday-making
and sight-seeing Country Cousin.
I made my way into the Birdcage walk, and
so through Palace-yard down to the stairs
at the foot of where they were driving the
first piles of that great structure which is
now called Westminster Bridge. Here a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Waterman agreed to take me to the Tower
stairs for a shilling, which was not above
thrice his legal fare, but yokels and simpletons
are common prey in this great village
of London. I observed more than once as
he rowed me down stream that we were followed
by a heavy wherry, manned by stout,
smart fellows in frocks of blue duck, who
kept stroke remarkably well together, and
whose coxswain eyed me very narrowly.
As we were shooting one of the narrow
arches of London Bridge&mdash;(then covered
with shops and houses, with barbicans, and
traitors' heads spiked upon 'em at each end,
and I have heard old people say that many
a time they have fished for perch and grayling
standing on the starlings of the Bridge)&mdash;this
wherry fouled our craft, and my
waterman burst into a volley of horrible
ribald abuse, till he who was coxswain
among the blue-frocked gentry spake some
words to him in a low voice, at which he
touched his cap, and became quite Meek
and Humble. I caught him eyeing me,
quite as narrowly as the steersman of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
wherry had done, and when I asked him
what ailed him, he stuck his Tongue in his
cheek and grinned audaciously.</p>

<p>"Who were those rough fellows in the
wherry, yonder, that fouled us?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Bluebottles," says he, with another grin.</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean, fellow?" I continued.</p>

<p>"Well, fresh-water fishermen, if you
like," he went on, "that bait their hooks
with salt worms. Will you please pay me
my fare now, Master, since I am a Fellow
forsooth, and Murphy's Murrain to you?"</p>

<p>What Murphy's Murrain was&mdash;except
some term of waterside sculduddrey I did
not know&mdash;but I paid the knave his shilling,
whereupon he very importunately
craved another sixpence to drink my health,
saying that it might be a very long time
before he saw me again. Now I happened
only to have one and fourpence left in the
world, and suspecting that I had already
overpaid him, I resisted further extortion,
upon which he became more and more
clamorous for money, and finding that I
was as obstinate as he, rested on his oars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and declared that, burn him&mdash;with many
other execrations too unseemly to transcribe&mdash;he
would not pull a stroke further. This
it seems was by no means an uncommon
occurrence among the dishonest waterside
knaves of those days, and it afforded vast
sport to a mob of small craft that gathered
round, and the people in which covered
me with ridicule and abuse, calling me a
Thames Bilk, and advising the waterman to
hold me over the side of the boat by the
scruff of the neck and give me a Ducking.
I was in a great Quandary, and knew not
what to do.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the heavy wherry, which had
kept close in our offing, pulled almost on
board of us, and the coxswain hailed us to
know what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Here's a Holiday Tailor that would
seek to stump a poor waterman of his fare,"
quoth the false scoundrel who was striving
to rob me.</p>

<p>"'Tis a base lie!" I cried out; "I gave
him a shilling at Westminster stairs to row
me to the Tower wharf."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fare's only fourpence. Shame! shame!"
cried one part of the people in the small
craft.</p>

<p>"He's a Bilk," yelled another part of
'em. "Duck him, Goodman Crabs, duck
him."</p>

<p>"Stop," cries the coxswain of the wherry,
standing up. "It <i>is</i> a shame. The poor
fellow shan't be put upon. Here, young
man, step on board this, and we'll land you
at the Tower wharf for nothing; and here,
waterman, take this shilling and be d&mdash;d to
you, and sheer off before you can cry Poor
John."</p>

<p>The wherry by this time had got so close
on our quarter that, thanking the blue-frocked
gentlemen for their politeness, I
was able to step on board the wherry without
any difficulty. My thief of a waterman
took the shilling which was flung to him,
and again sticking his tongue in his cheek,
and grinning in a more unblushing manner
than before, pulled away. The crowd in
the small craft set up a cheer, that had
more of derision than approbation in it, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
I once more heard the cry of "Blue
Bottles."</p>

<p>These Blue Bottles, however, were as
good as their word, for five minutes afterwards
I was landed safe and sound at the
Tower wharf. I thanked them all very
heartily; but, as I had not enough money
to treat them all, made bold to confess the
narrowness of my means to the coxswain,
begging that he, at least, would do me the
honour to take a mug of flip&mdash;which could
be had, double allowance, for fourpence.
He clapped me, in reply, on the shoulder in
the most friendly manner, and said, roast
him, that he would not see me put upon;
that I was evidently a lad of mettle and
spirit, and that I should go with him to the
"Admiral Benbow," on Little Tower Hill,
close by, where he would himself stand treat
for as many mugs of flip or Punch as ever I
liked.</p>

<p>He would take no denial to his hospitable
proposal, so that I accompanied him to the
"Admiral Benbow," a snuggish little hostelry,
about which some half a score more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
stout fellows in blue frocks were lounging.
But these I noticed had broad leather belts
round their waists, in which were stuck
pistols, and to which hung cutlasses.</p>

<p>When we had made ourselves comfortable
in the little back parlour of the "Admiral
Benbow" over a steaming jug and a Pipe of
Tobacco, my companion began to ask me a
few questions, to which, with the ingenuous
candour of youth, I made full replies. I
told him that I was a young man seeking
my fortune, but had as yet come only on
very scurvy luck; that I had spent all my
money; that I had but recently come from
foreign parts, and that, in despite of finding
honest employment, I had made up my
mind to list for a soldier that very night.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, boy?" cried my friend
the coxswain. "Curse pipeclay and red
blanketing, and the life of a swaddy. The
sea, the blue glorious sea's the place for a
bold heart like you."</p>

<p>I answered that I knew not enough of
seamanship to take the place of an officer,
and that I considered the condition of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
common sailor as too base for one of my
bringing up.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay! you shall be an officer in
time, my hearty," answered the Coxswain&mdash;"Lord
High Admiral, for a certainty; but
you must creep through the hawse-holes
first. There's nothing like half-a-dozen
cruises before the mast for taking the conceit
out of a maple-faced hobbledehoy."</p>

<p>Whether I was maple-faced or not, I did
not stay to argue; but there was something
about the mahogany face of the coxswain
that misliked me much. Now that I inspected
him closely I recognised in him
something of that mangonising or slave-dealing
expression which is burnt in as with
a Red-hot Iron upon the countenances of all
those whose trade is kidnapping and man-stealing.
So without more ado I rose to go,
thanking him for his treat, and saying that
if I went to sea it should be at my own
pleasure and in my own way.</p>

<p>"Stop abit," he answered, rising with me,
and putting his back against the door&mdash;"not
so fast, my hearty! King George doesn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
allow likely young blades to slip through
his fingers in this fashion. As you're in
such a deuce of a hurry, I think we'd better
see the Midshipmite."</p>

<p>I measured him with my eye, but at once
gave up all thoughts of mastering him if I
attempted violence in leaving the room. He
was taller than I, broader across the chest,
older, his limbs better knit, and in every
way the more powerful. He too, I saw, was
taking stock of me, and marking from my
Frame and my Mien that, although young,
I was likely to prove an Ugly Customer, he
outs with a pistol from under his jerkin, and
holds it to my head with one hand, while
with the other he blows a smart call upon a
silver whistle suspended by a lanyard round
his neck.</p>

<p>In a moment the room was full of blue-frocked
ruffians; a dozen pistols were levelled
at my head, a dozen cutlasses drawn menacingly
against me. Before I knew where I
was I was tripped up, knocked down from
behind, a gag forced into my mouth, and a
pair of handcuffs slipped on to my wrists.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"No offence, shipmate," said a big fellow
with black whiskers, as he knelt on my chest
and screwed the manacles on so tightly that
I gave a scream of pain. "We always begin
in this here way&mdash;we crimps our cod
before we cooks it. To-morrow morning,
when you've had your grog, you'll be as
gentle as a lamb, and after your first cruise
you'll be as ready as ere a one of us to come
cub-hunting."</p>

<p>Upon this there entered the room he
whom the coxswain had spoken of as the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Mishipmite'">Midshipmite</ins>, and who I rightly conjectured
to be in authority over these dare-devils.
He was a young man wearing his own hair,
which was bright red. His face was all
covered with pimples, and his mouth was
harelipped from a sword cut. He had canvas
bags and grey ribbed hose like a common
sailor, but his hat was bound with a
scrap of dirty gold lace; he had a hanger
at his side, and on his threadbare blue coat
I could see the King's button. Withal he
was a very precise gentleman, and would
listen to nothing but facts. He bade his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
men remove the gag from my mouth, and
then addressed me.</p>

<p>"The fact of the matter is," says he,
"that you've been kicking up a devil of a
row, and that you'd much better have gone
quietly with the coxswain."</p>

<p>"Why am I kidnapped? why have you
put these footpad bracelets on me?" I cried
out, passionately.</p>

<p>"The fact of the matter is that we always
do it to save time and trouble," answered
the Midshipmite&mdash;"Easy and quiet is the
word at the 'Admiral Benbow.'"</p>

<p>"I'll have the law of you!" I exclaimed,
in a rage.</p>

<p>"Exactly so," quoth the Midshipmite,
quite politely. "May I ask if you're a free-man
of the City of London?"</p>

<p>"I am not."</p>

<p>"Precisely so. Are you a waterman, duly
entered at your Hall, and all arrears paid
up, or an apprentice, carrying your indentures
with you?"</p>

<p>"I am not, and I don't know what you
mean."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then the fact of the matter is," said the
Midshipmite, with a chuckle, "that we've
got the law of <i>you</i>. The King, God bless
him, wants stout and gallant hearts to man
his fleet, and you're about the likeliest young
fellow I've seen this week; so the best thing
you can do is to go willingly on board the
Tower Tender, of which I have the honour
to be second in command. If you won't,
the fact of the matter is that we must make
you."</p>

<p>"But why should I go with you?" I
urged.</p>

<p>"The fact of the matter is that you're
Pressed," coolly answered the Midshipmite,
or midshipman, "and if you want to see the
warrant, you may ask Davy Jones for it, who
keeps it under three seals in his locker to
prevent accidents."</p>

<p>Between listing for a soldier and being
pressed for a sailor there was not, I take it,
much difference. Either way, the chance of
a livelihood offered itself. But I did not
like this violent way of doing things, and I
told the midshipman so. He merely ordered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
his blue-frocks to take me away. Then I
attempted to burst my bonds, and bit,
kicked, and struggled, so that it took half-a-dozen
men to drag me to the door.</p>

<p>"The fact of the matter is," remarked the
midshipman, filling himself a glass of punch,
"that there's always this hullabaloo at the
first going off, and that you'd better give
him One for peace and quietness."</p>

<p>Somebody immediately followed the officer's
advice, and gave me One with the butt
end of a pistol, which nearly clove my skull
in twain, and certainly made me peaceable
and quietness, for it stunned me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.</h2>

<h3>JOHN DANGEROUS IS IN THE SERVICE OF
KING GEORGE.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> now becomes expedient for me to pass
over no less than Fifteen Years of my momentous
Career. I am led to do this for
divers cogent Reasons, two of which I will
forthwith lay before my Reader. For the
first, let me urge a Decent Prudence. It is
not, Goodness knows, that I have any thing
to be ashamed of which should hinder me
from giving a Full, True, and Particular
Account of all the Adventures that befell
me in these same fifteen Years, with the same
Minute Particularity which I bestowed upon
my Unhappy Childhood, my varied Youth,
and stormy Adolescence. I did dwell, perhaps,
with a fonder circumspection and more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
scrupulous niceness upon those early days,
inasmuch as the things we have first known
and suffered are always more vividly presented
to our mind when we strive to recall
'em, sitting as old men in the ingle-nook,
than are the events of complete manhood.
Yet do I assure those who have been at the
pains to scan the chapters that have gone
before, that it would be easy for me to sit
down with the Fidelity of a Ledger-Keeper
all the things that happened unto me from
my <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'eiteenth'">eighteenth</ins> year, when I last bade them
leave, and the year 1747, when I had come
to be three-and-thirty years of age. I
remember all: the Ups and Downs; the
Crosses and the Runs of Luck; the Fortunes
and Misfortunes; the Good and the
Bad Feasts I sat me down to, during an
ever-changing and Troublous Period. But,
as I have said, I have been moved thus to
skip over a vast tract of time through Prudence.
There may have been certain items
in my life upon which, now that I am respectable
and prosperous, I no more care to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
think of. There may be whole pages, close-written
and full of Stirring Matter, which I
have chosen to cancel; there may be occurrences
treated of which it is best, at this
time of Day, to draw a Veil over. Finally,
there may be Great Personages still Living
who would have just cause to be Offended
were I to tell all I know. The dead belong
to all the World, and their Bones are oft-times
Dug up and made use of by those
who in the Flesh knew them not; but
Famous Persons live to a very Great Age,
and it is sometimes scandalous to recount
what adventures one has had with 'em in
the days of their hot and rash Youth. Had
I permission to publish all I am acquainted
with, the very Hair upon your Head might
stand up in Amazement at some of the
Matters I could relate:&mdash;how Mean and
Base the Great and Powerful might become;
how utterly Despisable some of the
most Superb and Arrogant Creatures of this
our Commonwealth might appear. But I
am prudent and Hold my Tongue.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>

Again, and for the Second Reason, I am
led to pass over these fifteen years through
a feeling that is akin to Mercy and Forbearance
towards my Reader. For I well know
how desperately given is John Dangerous to
a wordy Garrulity&mdash;how prone he is to make
much of little things, and to elevate to the
dignity of Important and Commanding
Events that which is perchance only of the
very slightest moment. By Prosing and
Amplifying, by Moralizing and Digressing,
by spinning of yarns and wearing of reflections
threadbare, I might make a Great
Book out of the pettiest and most uneventful
career; but even in honestly transcribing
my actual adventures, one by one,&mdash;the
things I have done, and the Men and Women
I have known,&mdash;I should imperceptibly
swell a Narrative, which was at first meant
to attain no great volume, to most deplorable
dimensions. And the World will no
longer tolerate Huge Chronicles in Folio,
whether they relate to History, to Love or
Adventure, to Voyages and Travels, or even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to Philosophy, Mechanics, or the Useful
Arts. The world wants smart, dandy little
volumes, as thin as a Herring, and just as
Salt. For these two reasons, then, do I
nerve myself to a sudden leap, and entreat
you now to think no longer of John Dangerous
as a raw youth of eighteen summers,
but as a sturdy, well-set man of thirty-three.</p>

<p>Yet, lest mine Enemies and other vile
Rascal Fellows that go about the town taking
away the characters of honest people
for mere Envy and Spitefulness' sake, lest
these petty curmudgeons should, in their
own sly saucy manner, Mop and Mow, and
Grin and Whisper, that If I am silent as to
Fifteen Years of my Sayings and Doings, I
have good cause for holding my peace,&mdash;lest
these scurril Slanderers should insinuate
that during this time I lay in divers Gaols
for offences which I dare not avow, that I
was concerned in Desperate and Unlawful
Enterprises which brought upon me many
Indictments in the King's Courts, or that I
was ever Pilloried, or held to Bail for contemptible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
misdemeanours,&mdash;I do here declare
and affirm that for the whole of the
time I so pass over I earned my bread in a
perfectly Honest, Legal, and Honourable
Manner, and that I never once went out of
the limits of the United Kingdom. I have
heard, indeed, a Ridiculous Tale setting
forth that, finding myself Destitute in London
after the Chaplain, Mr Pinchin, and
I had parted company, and after escaping
from the Pressgang, I enlisted in
the Foot Guards. The preposterous Fable
goes on to say that quickly mastering my
Drill, and being a favourite with my officers,
whom I much pleased with my Alacrity and
Intelligence, although they were much given
to laugh at my assumptions of superior
Birth, and nicknamed me "Gentleman
Jack,"&mdash;I was promoted to the rank of
Corporal, and might have aspired to the
dignity of a Sergeant's Halbert, but that in
a Mad Frolic one night I betook myself to
the road as a Footpad, and robbed a Gentleman,
coming from the King's Arms, Kensington,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
towards the Weigh House at
Knightsbridge, of fourteen spade guineas,
a gold watch, and a bottle-screw. And
that being taken by the Hue and Cry, and
had before Justice de Veil then sitting at
the Sun Tavern in Bow Street, I should
have been committed to Newgate, tried, and
most likely have swung for the robbery, but
for the strong intercession of my Captain,
who was a friend of the Gentleman robbed.
That I was indeed enlarged, but was not
suffered to go scot-free, inasmuch as, being
tried by court-martial for absence without
leave on the night of the gentleman's misfortune,
I was sentenced to receive three
hundred lashes at the halberts. Infamous
and Absurd calumnies!</p>

<p>Behold me, then, in the beginning of the
year 1747 in the Service of his Sacred
Majesty King George the Second. Behold
me, further, installed in no common Barrack,
mean Guard-house, or paltry Garrison Town,
but in one of the most famous of his Majesty's
Royal Fortresses:&mdash;a place that had been at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
once and for centuries (ever since the days of
Julius C&aelig;sar, as I am told) a Palace, a
Citadel, and a Prison. In good sooth, I was
one of the King's Warders, and the place
where I was stationed was the Ancient and
Honourable Tower of London.</p>

<p>Whether I had ever worn the King's uniform
before, either in scarlet as a Soldier in
his armies, or of blue and tarpaulin as a
Sailor in his Fleets, or of brown as a Riding
Officer in his customs,&mdash;under which guise a
man may often have doughty encounters
with smugglers that are trying to run their
contraband cargoes, or to hide their goods
in farmers' houses,&mdash;or of green, as a Keeper
in one of the Royal Chases,&mdash;I absolutely
refuse to say. Here I am, or rather here
I was, a Warder and in the Tower.</p>

<p>I was bravely accoutred. A doublet of
crimson cloth, with the crown, the Royal
Cipher G. R., and a wreath of laurel embroidered
in gold, both on its back and
front; a linen ruff, well plaited, round my
neck, sleeves puffed with black velvet, trunk-hose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of scarlet, rosettes in my slashed shoes,
and a flat hat with a border of the red and
white roses of York and Lancaster in satin
ribbon,&mdash;these made up my costume. There
were forty of us in the Tower, mounting
guard with drawn swords at the portcullis
gate and at the entrances to the lodgings of
such as were in hold, and otherwise attending
upon unfortunate noblemen and gentlemen
who were in trouble. On state occasions,
when taking prisoners by water from the
Tower to Westminster, and in preceding
the Lieutenant to the outward port, we carried
Halberts or Partisans with tassels of
gold and crimson thread. But although
our dress was identical, as you may
see from the prints, with that of the Beef-Eaters,
we Tower Warders were of a very
different kidney to the lazy hangers-on about
St. James's. Those fellows were Anybodies,
Parasites of Back-Stairs favourites, and spies
and lacqueys, transformed serving-men,
butlers past drawing corks, grooms and
porters, even. They had nothing to do but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
loiter about the antechambers and staircases
of St. James's, to walk by the side of his
Majesty's coach when he went to the Houses
of Parliament, or to fight with the Marshalmen
at Royal Funerals for petty spoils of
wax-candles or shreds of black hangings.
The knaves actually wore wigs, and powdered
them, as though they had been so many
danglers on the Mall. They passed their
time, when not in requisition about the
Court, smoking and card-playing in the
taverns and mug-houses about Scotland
Yard and Spring Gardens. They had the
run of a few servant-wenches belonging to
great people, but we did not envy them
their sweethearts. Some of them, I verily
believe, were sunk so low as, when they were
not masquerading at court, to become tavern-drawers,
or ushers and cryers in the courts
of law about Westminster. A very mean
people were these Beef-eaters, and they toiled
not, neither did they spin, for the collops
they ate.</p>

<p>But we brave boys of the Tower earned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
both our Beef and our Bread, and the abundant
Beer and Strong Waters with which
we washed our victuals down. We were
military men, almost all. Some of us had
fought at Blenheim or Ramilies&mdash;these were
the veterans: the very juniors had made the
French Maison du Roy scamper, or else
crossed bayonets with the Irish Brigade (a
brave body of men, but deplorably criminal
in carrying arms against a Gracious and
Clement Prince) in some of those well-fought
German Fields, in which His Royal
Highness the Duke and my Lord George
Sackville (since Germaine, and my very good
friend and Patron) covered themselves with
immortal glory. Nay some of us, One of us
at least, had fought and bled, to the amazement
of his comrades and the admiration
of his commanders,&mdash;never mind where.
'Tis not the luck of every soldier to have
had his hand wrung by the Great Duke of
Cumberland, or to have been presented with
ten guineas to drink his health withal by
Field-Marshal Wade. We would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
thought it vile poltroonery and macaronism
to have worn wigs&mdash;to say nothing of powder&mdash;unless,
indeed, the peruke was a true Malplaquet
club or Dettingen scratch.</p>

<p>Our duties were no trifling ones, let me
assure you. The Tower, as a place of
military strength, was well looked after by
the Regiment of Foot Guards and the
Companies of Artillery that did garrison
duties on its ramparts and the foot of its
drawbridges; but to us was confided a
charge much more onerous, and the custody
of things much more precious. We had
other matters to mind besides seeing that
stray dogs did not venture on to the Tower
Green, that dust did not get into the cannon's
mouths, or that Grand Rounds received
proper salutes. Was not the Imperial
Crown of England in our keeping? Had
we not to look after the Royal diadem, the
orb, the sceptre, the Swords of Justice and
of Mercy, and the great parcel-gilt Salt
Cellar that is moulded in the likeness of
the White Tower itself? Did it not behove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
us to keep up a constant care and watchfulness,
lest among the curious strangers
and country cousins who trudged to the
Jewel House to see all that glittering and
golden finery, and who gave us shillings to
exhibit them, there might be lurking some
Rogue as dishonest and as desperate as that
Colonel Blood who so nearly succeeded in
getting away with the crown and other
valuables in King Charles the Second's
time. Oh! I warrant you that we kept
sharp eyes on the curious strangers and the
country cousins, and allowed them not to
go too near the grate behind which were
those priceless baubles.</p>

<p>But another charge had we, I trow. Of
all times had this famous fortress of the
Tower of London been a place of hold for
the King's prisoners. Felons, nor cutpurses,
nor wantons suffered we indeed in our precincts,
nor gave we the hospitality of dungeons
to; but of state prisoners, noblemen
and gentlemen in durance for High Treason,
or for other offences against the Royal State<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and Prerogative, had we always a plentiful
store. Some of the greatest Barons&mdash;the
proudest names in England&mdash;have pined
their lives away within the Tower's inexorable
walls. Walls! why there were little
dungeons and casemates built in the very
thickness of those huge mural stones. In
ancient days I have heard that foul deeds
were common in the fortress&mdash;that princes
were done to Death here&mdash;notably the two
poor Royal infants that the wicked Richard
of Gloucester bid his hell-hounds smother
and bury at the foot of the stairs in that
building which has ever since gone by the
name of the Bloody Tower. So, too, I am
afraid it is a true bill that Torture was
in the bad old days indiscriminately used
towards both gentle and simple in some
gloomy underground places in this said
Tower. I have heard of a Sworn Tormentor
and his assistants, whose fiendish
task it was to torture poor creatures' souls
out of their miserable bodies, and of a
Chirurgeon who had to watch lest the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
agonies used upon 'em should be too much
for human endurance, and so, putting 'em
out of their misery, rob the headsman of
his due, the scaffold of its prey, and the vile
mobile that congregate at public executions
of their raree show. Of "Scavenger's
Daughters," Backs, Thumbscrews, iron
boots, and wedges, and other horrible
engines of pain, I have heard many dismal
tales told; but all had long fallen into
disuse before my time. The last persons
tortured within the Tower walls were, I
believe, Colonel Faux (Guido) and his confederates,
for their most abominable Gunpowder
Plot, which was to put an end to
the Protestant Religion and the illustrious
House of Stuart at one fell blow; but happily
came to nothing, through the prudence
of my Lord Monteagle, and the well-nigh
superhuman sagacity of his Majesty King
James the First. Guy and his accomplices
they tortured horribly; and did not even
give 'em the honour of being beheaded on
Tower Hall,&mdash;they being sent away as common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
traitors to Old Palace Yard (close to
the scene of their desperately meditated
but fortunately abortive crime), and there
half-hanged, cut down while yet warm,
disembowelled, their Hearts and Inwards
taken out and burnt by Gregory (that was
hangman then, and that, as Gregory Brandon,
had a coat-of-arms given him as a
gentleman, through a fraud practised upon
Garter King), and their mangled bodies&mdash;their
heads severed&mdash;cut into quarters, well
coated with pitch, and stuck upon spikes
over London Bridge, east Portcullis, Ludgate,
Temple Bar, and other places of public
resort, according to the then bloody-minded
custom, and the statute in that case made
and provided. But after Colonel Guido
Faux, Back, Thumbscrews, boots, and
wedges, and Scavenger's daughters fell into
a decline, from which, thank God, they
have never, in this fair realm of England,
recovered. I question even if the Jesuit
Garnett and his fellows, albeit most barbarously
executed, were tortured in prison;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
but it is certain that when Felton killed
the Duke of Bucks at Portsmouth, and was
taken red-handed, the Courtiers, Parasites,
and other cruel persons that were about
the King, would fain have had him racked;
but the public,&mdash;which by this time had
begun to inquire pretty sharply about
Things of State,&mdash;cried out that Felton
should not be tormented (their not loving
the Duke of Bucks too much may have
been one reason for their wishing some
degree of leniency to be shown to the
assassin), and the opinion of the Judges
being taken, those learned Persons, in full
court of King's Bench assembled, decided
that Torture was contrary to the Law of
England, and could not legally be used
upon any of the King's subjects howsoever
guilty he might have been.</p>

<p>But I confess that when I first took up
service as a Tower Warder, and gazed upon
those horrible implements of Man's cruelty
and hard-heartedness collected in the Armoury,
I imagined with dismay that, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
rusty as they had grown, there might be
occasions for them to be used upon the
persons of unfortunate captives. For I
had lived much abroad, and knew what
devilish freaks were often indulged in by
arbitrary and unrestrained power. But my
comrades soon put my mind at ease, and
pointed out to me that few, very few, of
these instruments of Anguish were of English
use or origin at all; but that the great
majority of these wicked things were from
among the spoils of the Great Armada,
when the proud Spaniards, designing to
invade this free and happy country with
their monstrous Flotilla of Caravels and
Galleons, provided numerous tools of Torture
for despitefully using the Heretics (as
they called them) who would not obey the
unrighteous mandates of a foreign despot,
or submit to the domination (usurped) of
the Bishop of Rome. And so tender indeed
of the bodies of the King's prisoners
had the Tower authorities become, that the
underground dungeons were now never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
used, commodious apartments being provided
for the noblemen and gentlemen in
hold: and a pretty penny they had to pay
for their accommodation; five guineas a
day, besides warder and gentlemen gaolers'
fees, being the ordinary charge for a nobleman,
and half that sum for a knight and
private esquire. Besides this, the Lieutenant
of the Tower had a gratuity of
thirty pounds from every peer that came
into his custody, and twenty pounds for
every gentleman writing himself <i>Armiger</i>,
and in default could seize upon their cloaks:
whence arose a merry saying&mdash;"best go to
the Tower like a peeled carrot than come
forth like one."</p>

<p>There were even no chains used in this
state prison; of fetters and manacles we
had indeed a plenitude, all of an antique
pattern and covered with rust; but no irons
such as are put upon their prisoners by
vulgar gaolers in Newgate and elsewhere.
I have heard say, that when poor Counsellor
Layer, that was afterwards hanged, drawn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and quartered as a Jacobite, and his head
stuck atop of Temple Bar hard by his own
chambers,&mdash;was first brought for safer custody
to the Tower, breakings out of Newgate
having been common, the Government
sent down word that, as a deep-dyed conspirator
and desperate rebel, he was to be
double-ironed. Upon this Mr. Lieutenant
flies into a mighty heat, and taking boat to
Whitehall, waits on Mr. Secretary at the
Cockpit, and tells him plainly that such an indignity
towards his Majesty's prisoners in the
Tower was never heard of, that no such base
modes of coercion as chains or bilboes had
ever been known in use since the reign of
King Charles I., and that the King's
warders were there to see that the prisoners
did not attempt Evasion. To which Mr.
Secretary answered, with a grim smile, that
notwithstanding all the keenness of the
watch and ward, he had often heard of prisoners
escaping from durance in the Tower,
notably mentioning the case of my Lord
Nithesdale, who escaped in his lady's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
clothes, and without more ado informed the
Lieutenant that Counsellor Layer must be
chained as directed, even if the chains had
to be forged expressly for him. Upon which
Mr. Lieutenant took a very surly leave of
the Great Man, cursing him as he comes
down the steps for a Thief-catcher and
Tyburn purveyor, and sped him to Newgate,
where he borrowed a set of double-irons
from the Peachum or Lockit, or whatever
the fellow's name it was that kept that Den
of Thieves. And even then, when they had
gotten the chains to the Tower, none of the
warders knew how to put them on, or cared
to sully their fingers with such hangman's
work; and so they were fain to have a blacksmith
with his anvil, and a couple of turnkeys
down from Newgate, to rivet the chains
upon the poor gentleman's limbs; he being
at the time half dead of a Strangury; but
so cruel was justice in those days.</p>

<p>When I first came to the Tower, we had
but few prisoners; for it was before the
Great Rebellion of the 'Forty-five; and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'fo'">for</ins><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
a few years previous the times had been
after a manner quiet. Now and then some
notorious Jacobite, Seminarist, or seditious
person was taken up; but he was rarely of
sufficient importance to be confined in our
illustrious Prison; and was either had to Newgate,
or else incarcerated in the lodgings of
a King's Messenger till his examinations
were over, and he was either committed or
Enlarged. These Messengers kept, in those
days, a kind of Sponging Houses for High
Treason, where Gentlemen Traitors who
were not in very great peril lived, as it were,
at an ordinary, and paid much dearer for
their meat and lodging than though they
had been at some bailiffs lock-up in Cursitor
Street, or Tooke's Court, or at the Pied Bull
in the Borough. We had, it is true, for a
long time a Romanist Bishop that was suspected
of being in correspondence with St.
Germain's, and lay for a long time under
detention. He was a merry old soul, and
most learned man; would dine very gaily
with Mr. Lieutenant, or his deputy, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the Fort Major, swig his bottle of claret,
and play a game of tric-trac afterwards;
and it was something laughable to watch
the quiet cunning way in which he would
seek to Convert us Warders who had the
guarding of him to the Romanist faith.
They let him out at last upon something
they called a <i>Nolle prosequi</i> of the Attorney-General,
or some suchlike dignitary of the
law&mdash;which <i>nolle prosequi</i> I take to be a
kind of <i>habeas corpus</i> for gentlefolks. He
was as liberal to us when he departed as his
means would allow; for I believe that save
his cassock, his breviary, a gold cross round
his neck, and episcopal ring, and a portmantel
full of linen, the old gentleman had
neither goods nor chattels in the wide world:
indeed, we heard that the Lieutenant lent
him, on leaving, a score of gold pieces, for
friendship-sake, to distribute among us. But
he went away&mdash;to foreign parts, I infer&mdash;with
flying colours; for every body loved
the old Bishop, all Romanist and suspected
Jacobite as he was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came that dreadful era of rebellion
of which I have spoken, and we Tower
Warders found that our holiday time was
over. Whilst the war still raged in Scotland,
scarcely a day passed without some
person of consequence being brought either
by water to Traitor's Gate, or by a strong
escort of Horse and Foot to the Tower
Postern; not for active participation in the
Rebellion, but as a measure of safety, and to
prevent worse harm being done. And many
persons of consequence, trust me, saved their
heads by being laid by the heels for a
little time while the hue and cry was afoot,
and Habeas Corpus suspended. Fast bind,
safe find, is a true proverb; and you may
thank your stars, even if your enemies have for
a time bound you with chains and with links
of iron, if, when the stormy season has gone
past, you find your head still safe on your
shoulders. Now it was a great Lord who
was brought to the Tower, and from whom
Mr. Lieutenant did not forget to claim his
thirty-pound fee on entrance; for "here to-day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
gone to-morrow," he reasoned, and so
shot his game as soon as he had good parview
of the same. Now it was some Cheshire
or Lancashire Squire, snatched away from
his Inn, at the Hercules' Pillars, or the
Catherine Wheel in the Borough, as being
vehemently suspected of Jacobitism. These
gentlemen mostly took their captivity in a
very cheerful and philosophical manner.
They would call for a round of spiced beef,
a tankard of ale, and a pipe of tobacco, so
soon as ever they were fairly bestowed in
their lodgings; drank to the King&mdash;taking
care not to let us know whether his name
began with a G or a J, with many jovial
ha-has, and were as happy as the day was
long, so it seemed to us, if they had but a
pack of cards and a volume of the Gentleman's
Recreation, or Academy of Field
Sports. What bowls of punch, too, they
would imbibe o' nights, and what mad
carouses they would have! Such roaring
Squires as these would have been much
better bestowed in the Messengers' Houses;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
but these were all full, likewise the common
gaols; nay, the debtors' prisons and vile
sponging-houses were taken up by Government
for the temporary incarceration of
suspected persons.</p>

<p>How well do I remember the dreadful
amazement and consternation which broke
over this city when the news came that the
Prince&mdash;I mean the Pretender&mdash;had utterly
routed the King's troops commanded by Sir
John Cope at Prestonpans; that the Misguided
Young Man had entered Edinborough
at the head of a furious mob of
Highlandmen, whose preposterous style of
dress I never could abide, and who in
those days we Southrons held as being
very little better than painted Savages;
that the ladies of the Scottish capital had
all mounted the white cockade, and were
embroidering scarves for the Pretender and
his officers, and that the Castle of Edinborough
alone held out 'gainst this monstrous
uprising to destroy authority! But
how much greater was the Dismay in London<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
when we learnt that the Rebels, not satisfied
with their conquests in his Majesty's Scottish
Dominions, had been so venturous as
to invade England itself, and had actually
advanced so far as the trading town of
Derby! Then did those who had been long,
albeit obscurely, suspected of Jacobitism,
come forth from their lurking holes and
corners, and almost openly avow their preference
for the House of Stuart. Then did
very many respectable persons, formerly
thought to be excellently well affected towards
King George's person and Government,
become waverers, or prove themselves
the Turncoats they had always, in secret,
been, and seditiously prophesy that the days
of the Hanoverian dynasty were numbered.
Then did spies and traitors abound, together
with numbers of alarming rumours, that the
Chevalier had advanced as far as Barnet on
the Great North Road; that his Majesty
was about to convey himself away to
Hanover; that the Duke of Cumberland
was dead; that barrels of gunpowder had
been discovered in the Crypt beneath Guildhall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and in the vaults of the Chapel Royal;
that mutiny was rife among the troops;
that the Bank of England was about to
break, with sundry other distracting reports
and noises.</p>

<p>Of course authority did all it could to reassure
the public mind, tossed in a most
tempestuous manner as it was by conflicting
accounts. Authority bestirred itself to put
down seditious meetings by proclamation,
and to interdict residence in the capital to
all known Papists; whereby several most
estimable Catholic gentlemen (as many there
be of that old Faith) were forced to leave
their Town Houses, and betake themselves
to mean and inconvenient dwellings in the
country. The gates of Temple Bar were
now shut, on sudden alarms, two or three
times a week; as though the closing of
these rotten portals could in any way
impede the progress of rebellion, or
do any thing more than further to
hamper the already choked-up progress
of the streets. The Lord Mayor was
mighty busy calling out the Train-bands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and having them drilled in Moorfields, for
the defence of the City; and a mighty fine
show those citizen soldiers would have
made no doubt to the bare-legged Highlandmen,
had they come that way. The
Guards at all the posts at the Court end of
the town were doubled, and we at the
Tower put ourselves into a perfect state of
defence. Cannon were run out; matches
kept lighted; whole battalions maintained
under arms; munitions and provisions of
war laid in, as though to withstand a regular
siege; drawbridges pulled up and portcullises
lowered, with great clanking of
chains and gnashing of old iron teeth;&mdash;and
rich sport it was to see those old rust-eaten
engines once more brought into gear
again.</p>

<p>But, as the Wise Man saith that a soft
answer turneth away wrath, so do we often
find that a merry word spoken in season
will do more than all your Flaming Ordinances,
and Terrific Denunciations of Fire
and Sword. And although at this time
(beginning of the year 1746) authority very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
properly exerted itself to procure obedience
to the constitution, by instilling Awe into
men's minds, and did breathe nothing in its
official documents but heading, hanging,
and quartering, with threats of bombardments,
free quarters, drum-head courts-martial,
chains, gags, fines, imprisonment, and
sequestration,&mdash;yet I question whether so
much good was done by these towards the
stability of the cause of the Protestant
Religion and King George, or so much
harm to that of the Pretender, Popery,
brass money, and wooden shoes, as by
a little series of Pamphlets put forth
by the witty Mr. Henry Fielding, a writer
of plays and novels then much in
vogue; but a sad loose fish, although he
afterwards, as I am told, did good service to
the State as one of the justices of peace for
Middlesex, and helped to put down many
notorious gangs of murderers, highwaymen,
and footpads infesting the metropolis. This
Mr. Fielding&mdash;whom his intimates used to
call Harry, and whom I have often seen
lounging in the Temple Gardens, or about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the gaming-houses in St. James's Street, and
whom I have often met, I grieve to say, in
the very worst of company under the Piazzas
in Covent Garden much overtaken in liquor,
and his fine Lace clothes and curled periwig
all besmirched and bewrayed after a carouse&mdash;took
up the Hanoverian cause very hotly,&mdash;having
perhaps weighty reasons for so
doing&mdash;and, making the very best use of his
natural gifts and natural weapons, namely,
a very strong and caustic humour, with most
keen and trenchant satire, did infinite harm
to the Pretender's side by laughing at him
and his adherents. He published, probably
at the charges of authority,&mdash;for he was a
needy gentleman, always in love, in liquor,
or in debt,&mdash;a paper called the <i>True Patriot</i>,
in which the Jacobites were most mercilessly
treated. Notably do I recall a sort of sham
diary or almanack, purporting to be written
by an honest tradesman of the City during
the predicted triumph of the Pretender,
and in which such occurrences were noted
down as London being at the mercy of
Highlanders and Friars; Walbrook church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and many others being razed to the ground;
Father O'Blaze, a Dominican, exulting over
it; Queen Anne's statue at Paul's taken
away, and a large Crucifix erected in its
place; the Bank, South-Sea, India Houses,
&amp;c. converted into convents; Father Macdagger,
the Royal confessor, preaching at
St. James's; three Anabaptists hung at
Tyburn, attended by their ordinary, Mr.
Machenly (a grotesque name for the ranting
fellow who was wont to be known as Orator
Henley); Father Poignardini, an Italian
Jesuit, made Privy-Seal; four Heretics
burnt in Smithfield; the French Ambassador
made a Duke, with precedence; Cape
Breton given back to the French, with Gibraltar
and Port Mahon to the Spaniards;
the Pope's nuncio entering London, and the
Lord Mayor and Aldermen kissing his feet;
an office opened in Drury Lane for the sale
of papistical Pardons and Indulgences;
with the like prophecies calculated to arouse
the bigotry of the lower and middle orders,
and to lash them into a religious as well
as a political frenzy. For a cry of "No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Popery" has ever acted upon a true-born
Englishman as a red rag does on a bull.
Perhaps the thing that went best down of
all Mr. Fielding's drolleries, and tickled the
taste of the town most amazingly, was the
passage where he made his honest London
tradesman enter in his diary to this effect:
"My little boy Jacky taken ill of the itch.
He had been on the parade with his godfather
the day before to see the Life Guards,
and had just touched one of their plaids."
One of the King's Ministers said long afterwards
that this passage touching the itch
was worth two regiments of horse to the
cause of Government. At this distance of
time one doesn't see much wit in a scurrilous
lampoon, of which the gist was to
taunt one's neighbours with being afflicted
with a disease of the skin: and, indeed, the
lower ranks of English were, in those days,
anything but free from similar ailments, and,
in London at least, were in their persons and
manners inconceivably filthy. But 'tis
astonishing what a mark you can make with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
a coarse jest, if you only go far enough, and
forswear justice and decency.</p>

<p>Strange but true is it to remark that, in
the midst of all such tremendous convulsions
as wars, battles, sieges, rebellions, and other
martial conflagrations, men and women and
children do eat and drink, and love and
marry, and beget other babes of humanity,
and at last Die and turn to dust, precisely as
though the world&mdash;or rather the concerns of
that gross Orb&mdash;were all going on in their
ordinary jog-trot manner. Although from
day to day we people in London knew not
whether before the sun set the dreaded
pibroch of the Highland Clans might not
be heard at Charing Cross, and the barbarian
rout of Caterans that formed the Prince,&mdash;I
mean the Chevalier,&mdash;I mean the Pretender's
Army, scattered all about the City, plundering
our Chattels, and ravaging our fair English
homes; although, for aught men knew,
another month, nay another week, might see
King George the Second toppled from his
Throne, and King James the Third installed,
with his Royal Highness Charles Edward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Prince of Wales as Regent; although it was
but a toss-up whether the Archbishop of
Canterbury should not be ousted from Lambeth
by a Popish Prelate, and the whole
country reduced to Slavery and Bankruptcy;&mdash;yet
to those who lived quiet lives, and
kept civil tongues in their heads, all things
went on pretty much as usual: and each day
had its evil, and sufficient for the day was
the evil thereof. That the Highlandmen
were at Derby did not prevent the Hostess
of the Stone Kitchen&mdash;that famous Tavern
in the Tower&mdash;from bringing in one's
reckoning and insisting on payment. That
there was consternation at St. James's, with
the King meditating flight and the Royal
Family in tears and swooning, did not save
the little schoolboy a whipping if he knew
not his lesson at morning call. It will be
so, I suppose, until the end of the world.
We must needs eat and drink, and feel heat
and cold, and marry or be given in marriage,
whatsoever party prevail, and whatsoever
King carries crown and sceptre; and however
dreadful the crisis, we must have our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Dinners, and fleas will bite us, and corns
pinch our Feet. So while all the Public
were talking about the Rebellion, all the
world went nevertheless to the Playhouses,
where they played loyal Pieces and sang
"God save great George our King" every
night; as also to Balls, Ridottos, Clubs,
Masquerades, Drums, Routs, Concerts, and
Pharaoh parties. They read Novels and
flirted their fans, and powdered and patched
themselves, and distended their coats with
hoops, just as though there were no such
persons in the world as the Duke of Cumberland
and Charles Edward Stuart. And
in like manner we Warders in the Tower,
though ready for any martial emergency that
might turn up, were by no means unnecessarily
afeard or distraught with anxiety; but
ate and drank our fill, joked the pretty girls
who came to see the shows in the Tower,
and trailed our halberts in our usual jovial
devil-me-care manner, as true Cavaliers,
Warders in the service of his Majesty the
King, should do.</p>

<p>By and by came the news of Stirling and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Falkirk, after the disastrous retreat of the
Highlandmen back into England. And
then happened that short but tremendous
fight of Drummossie Moor, commonly called
the Battle of Culloden, where claymores and
Lochaber axes clashed and glinted for the
last time against English broadswords and
bayonets. After this was what was called
the pacification of the Highlands, meaning
that the Duke and his dragoons devastated
all before them with fire and sword; and
then "retributive justice" had its turn, and
the work of the Tower Warders began in
earnest.</p>

<p>Poor creatures! theirs was a hard fate.
At Carlisle, at Manchester, at Tyburn, and
at Kennington Common, London, how many
unhappy persons suffered death in its most
frightful form, to say nothing of the unspeakable
ignominy of being dragged on a
hurdle to the place of execution, and mangled
in the most horrible manner by the Hangman's
butcherly knife, merely because they
held that King James, and not King George,
was the rightful sovereign of these realms!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Is there in all History&mdash;at least insomuch as
it touches our sentiments and feelings&mdash;a
more lamentable and pathetic narration than
the story of Jemmy Dawson? This young
man, Mr. James Dawson by name,&mdash;for by
the endearing aggravative of Jemmy he is
only known in Mr. William Shenstone's
charming ballad (the gentleman that lived
at the Leasowes, and writ the Schoolmistress,
among other pleasing pieces, and spent so
much money upon Ornamental Gardening),&mdash;this
Mr. James Dawson, I say, was the
son of highly reputable parents, dwelling,
by some, 'tis said, in the county of Lancashire,
by others, in the county of Middlesex.
At all events, his father was a Gentleman of
good estate, who strove hard to bring up his
son in the ways of piety and virtue. But
the youth was wild and froward, and would
not listen to the sage Counsels that were
continually given him. After the ordinary
grammar-school education, during which
course he much angered his teachers,&mdash;less
by his reckless and disobedient conduct than
by his perverse flinging away of his opportunities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and manifest ignoring of the parts
with which he had been gifted by Heaven,&mdash;he
was sent to the University of Oxford to
complete the curriculum of studies necessary
to make him a complete gentleman. And
I have heard, indeed, that he was singularly
endowed with the properties requisite for
the making of that very rare animal:&mdash;that
he was quick, ready, generous, warm-hearted,
skilful, and accomplished,&mdash;that he rode,
and drove, and shot, and fenced, and swam,
and fished in that marvellously finished
manner only possible to those who seem to
have been destined by a capricious Fate to
do so well that which they have never
learned to do. And at college, who but
Jemmy Dawson&mdash;who but he? For a
wicked prank, or a mad carouse; for a
trick to be played on a proctor, or a kiss
to be taken by stealth,&mdash;who such a Master
of Arts as our young Undergraduate? But
at his lectures and chapels and repetitions he
was (although always with a vast natural
capacity) an inveterate Idler; and he did
besides so continually violate and outrage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the college rules and discipline, that his
Superiors, after repeated admonitions, gatings,
impositions, and rustications (which
are a kind of temporary banishment), were
at last fain solemnly to expel him from the
University. Upon which his father discarded
him from his house, vowing that he
would leave his broad acres (which were not
entailed) to his Nephew, and bidding him
go to the Devil; whither he accordingly
proceeded, but by a very leisurely and circuitous
route. But the young Rogue had
already made a more perilous journey than
this, for he had fallen in Love with a young
Madam of exceeding Beauty, and of large
Fortune in her own right, the daughter of
a neighbouring Baronet. And she, to her
sorrow, poor soul, became as desperately
enamoured of this young Scapegrace, and
would have run away with him, I have no
doubt, had he asked her, but for a spark of
honour which still remained in that reckless
Heart, and forbade his linking the young
girl, all good and pure as she was, to so
desperate a life as his. And so he went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
wandering for a time up and down the
country, swaggering with his boon companions,
and pawning his Father's credit in
whatsoever inns and pothouses he came
unto, until, in the beginning of that fatal
year '46, he must needs find himself at
Manchester without a Shilling in his pocket,
or the means of raising one. It was then
the time that the town of Manchester had
been captured, in the Pretender's interest,
by a Scots Sergeant and a Wench; and
the notorious Colonel Towneley was about
raising the Manchester Regiment of Lancashire
Lads to fight for Prince Charlie.
Desperate Jemmy Dawson enlisted under
Towneley; and soon, being a young fellow
of good figure and shining talents, was made
a Captain. But the ill-fated Manchester
Regiment was ere long broken up; and
Jemmy Dawson, with Colonel Towneley
himself, and many other of the officers,
were captured. They were all tried at the
Assizes held after the Assizes at St. Margaret's
Hill, Southwark; and James Dawson,
being convicted of high treason, was sentenced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
to the usual horrible punishment for
that offence. He was drawn on a hurdle to
Kennington Common; he was hanged, disembowelled,
and quartered; but the young
Madam of whom I have spoken was true
to him unto the last. For many days
following the sentence she vainly solicited
his pardon; but finding all useless, she on
the fatal morning (having trimmed a shroud
for him overnight, in which, poor Soul, his
mangled remains were not to rest) followed
him in a Mourning Coach to Kennington
Common. She saw the Dreadful Tragedy
played out to its very last Act; and then
she just turned on her Side in the Coach,
and with a soft Murmur, breathing Jemmy's
Name, she Died. Surely a story so piteous
as this needs no comment. And by Heaven
it is True!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THE NINTH.</h2>

<h3>REBELLION IS MADE AN END OF, AND AFTER SOME
FURTHER SERVICE WITH HIS MAJESTY I GO INTO
BUSINESS ON MY OWN ACCOUNT.</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Memorandum.</span>&mdash;About a year before the
Rebellion, as the Earl of Kilmarnock was
one day walking in his Garden, he was
suddenly alarmed with a fearful Shriek,
which, while he was reflecting on with
Astonishment, was soon after repeated. On
this he went into the House, and inquired
of his Lady and all the Servants, but could
not discover from whom or whence the Cry
proceeded; but missing his Lady's Woman,
he was informed that she was gone into
an Upper Room to inspect some Linen.
Whereupon the Earl and his Lady went
up and opened the Door, which was only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
latched. But no sooner did the Gentlewoman
within set eyes on his Lordship's
face than she fainted away. When, proper
aid being given to her, she was brought to
herself, they asked her the meaning of what
they had heard and seen. She replied, that
while she sat sewing some Linen she had
taken up to mend, the Door opened of itself,
and a <i>Bloody Head</i> entered the Room, and
rolled upon the Floor; that this dreadful
Sight had made her cry out, and then the
Bloody Head disappeared; that in a few
Moments she saw the same frightful Apparition
again, on which she repeated her
Shrieks; and at the third time she fainted
away, but was just recovered when she saw
his Lordship coming in, which had made
the Impression on her they had been witness
of.</div>

<p>This Relation given by the affrighted
Gentlewoman was only laughed at and
ridiculed as the Effect of Spleen-Vapours,
or the Frenzy of a deluded Imagination,
and was thought no more of, till one Night,
when the Earl of Kilmarnock, sitting round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
a Bowl by the Winter Fire with my Lord
Galloway,&mdash;and it is at such a Time that
men are most prone to fall-to telling of
Ghost Stories,&mdash;and their Lordships' conversation
turning on Spectres and Apparitions,
the vulgar notions of which they
were deriding, the terrible tale of the
Bloody Head was brought up, and then
dismissed as the idle fancy of a Hoity-toity
Tirewoman. But after Kilmarnock had
engaged in the Rebellion, and Lord Galloway
was told of it, he instantly recollected
this Story, and said, "I will wager a dozen
Magnums of Claret, and my best Silver-laced
Justaucorps, that my Lord Kilmarnock
will lose his Head."</p>

<p>Nobody took his bet, not daring thus to
trifle with the lives of the Quality; but
that Scots Lord lost his Head, notwithstanding;
and I saw it cut off on Tower
Hill in the latter summer of the year '46.</p>

<p>This story of the Bloody Head was
common Talk among us Warders at the
time,&mdash;who were full as superstitious as
other Folks, you may be sure. Many such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Legends are there, too, current of Persons
who were to die Violent Deaths at the
hands of the Public Executioner, being
forewarned many years before of their
Impending Fate. And sometimes hath
the Monition come nearer to the Catastrophe,
as in the case of K. C. the 1<sup>st</sup>,
who, entering Westminster Hall at that
Unnatural Assize presided over by Bradshaw,
the Gold Head fell off his Walking-Staff,
and rolled on the Pavement of the
Hall among the Soldiers; nor, when it was
restored to him, could any Efforts of his
make it remain on. Also it is said of
my Lord Derwentwater, that the last
time he went a hunting in the north, before
he joined the Old Chevalier of St.
George, his whippers-in unearthed a litter
of Fox-cubs, every one of which Vermin
had been born without Heads. And as
well authenticated is it, that when my
Lord Balmerino (that suffered on Tower
Hill with the Earl of Kilmarnock) was
coming back condemned to Death from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
his Trial before his Peers at Westminster,
his Lordship being of a merry, Epicurean
temper, and caring no more for Death than
a Sailor does for a wet Shirt, stopped the
coach at a Fruiterer's at Charing Cross,
where he must needs ask Mr. Lieutenant's
Attendant to buy him some Honey-Blobbs,
which is the Scottish name for ripe Gooseberries.</p>

<p>"And King Geordie maun pay for the
bit fruitie; for King James's auld soldier
has nae siller of his ain save twa guineas
for Jock Headsman," quoth he in his jocular
manner, meaning that those about him
must pay for the Gooseberries; for indeed
this Lord was very poor, and I have heard
was, when in town, so much driven as to
borrow money from the man who keeps
the Tennis-court in James Street, Haymarket.</p>

<p>Well, it so happened that the Season
was a backward one; and the Fruiterer
sends his duty out to his Lordship, saying
that he has no ripe Gooseberries, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
that of green ones he has a store, to
which that unfortunate Nobleman is heartily
welcome.</p>

<p>"I'll e'en try one," says my Lord; and
from a Punnet they brought him he picks
a Green Gooseberry; when, wonderful to
relate, it swells in his hand to the bigness
at least of an egg-plum, and turns the
colour of Blood. "The de'il's in the
Honey-Blobb," cries my Lord in a tiff,
and flings it out of window, where it
made a great red stain on the pavement.</p>

<p>And this the Warder who stood by, and
the Messenger who was in the coach itself,
told me.</p>

<p>Less need is there to speak of such strange
adventures as my Lady Nithisdale's child
(that was born soon after her Lord's escape
from the Tower, in which, with such a noble
valour and self-sacrifice, she aided him) being
brought into the World with a broad Axe
figured, as though by a Limner, on its Neck;
or of the Countess of Cromartie's infant (she
likewise Lay-in while the Earl was under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
sentence) having a thin red line or thread
right round its neck. These things are
perhaps to be accounted more as Phenomena
of nature than as ominous prognostications,
and I so dismiss 'em. But it is worth while
to note that, for all the good authority we
have of Lord Kilmarnock's Waiting-woman
being affrighted by the vision of a Bloody
Head, the story itself, or at least something
germane to it, is as old as the Hills. During
my travels in Sweden, I was told of a very
strange mischance that had happened to one
of their Kings who was named Charles;&mdash;but
Charles the what, I do confess I know
not;&mdash;who walking one evening in his
garden, saw all at once a Wing of the Palace,
that had been shut up and deserted for
Twenty years, all blazing with Light from
the Windows, as for some great Festival.
And his Majesty, half suspecting this might
be some Masquerading prank on the part of
the Court Ladies, and half afraid that there
was mischief in it, drew his Sword, and
calling upon a brace of his Gentlemen to
follow him, stave in a door and came into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Great Old Hall, that was the principal apartment
in the said Wing. And at the upper
End, where the ancient Throne of his
ancestors was long since gone to Rags and
Tatters, and abandoned to Dust and Cobwebs,
he saw, sitting on the chair of Estate,
and crowned, a little child that was then but
a boy&mdash;the Duke of Sudermania. And lo!
as he gazed upon him a Dreadful Ball, that
seemed fashioned in the similitude of his
own Head, showed itself under the Throne,
rolled down the steps, and so came on to his
very Feet, where it stopped, splashing his
Boots unto the very ankle with Gore. The
tale of the Bloody Boots, as 'tis called, is
still quite familiar to every Nurse in
Sweden; but I never heard how it ended,
or whether King Charles had his Head cut
off in the Long-run; but every Swede will
swear to the Story; and as for the Boots, I
have heard that they are to be seen, with
the dark brown stains of the Blood still upon
'em, in a glass case at the House of one Mr.
Herdstr&ouml;m, who sells Aqua Vit&aelig; over the Milliner's
in the Bogbindersgade at Stockholm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>'Twas in the summer of 1747 that I put
off my Warder's dress for good and all, the
Rebellion being by this time quite Dead
and crushed out; but before I laid down my
halbert 'twas my duty to assist at the
crowning consummation of that disastrous
Tragedy. One of the Prime Traitors in the
Scottish Risings had been, it is well known,
the notorious Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, of
Castle Downie, in Scotland, then come to be
Eighty years old, and as atrocious an old
Villain as ever lived, but so cunning that he
cheated the Gallows for three quarters of a
century, and died like a Gentleman, by the
Axe, at last. He had been mixed up in
every plot for the bringing back of King
James ever since the Old Chevalier's Father
gave up the Ghost at St. Germain's, yet had
somehow managed to escape scot-free from
Attainder and Confiscation. Even in the
'45, when he sent the Clan Fraser to join
the Young Chevalier, he tried his best to
make his poor Son, the Master of Lovat (a
very virtuous and gallant young Gentleman),
the scapegoat for his misdeeds, playing Fast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and Loose between France and the Jacobites
on one side, and the Lord Justice Clerk and
the King's Government on the other. But
Justice had him on the hip at last, and the
old Fox was caught. They brought him to
London by Easy Stages, as he was, or pretended
to be, mighty Infirm; and while he
was resting at an Inn at St. Alban's, Mr.
Hogarth the Painter (whom I have seen
many a time smoking a pipe and making
Caricatures of the Company at the Tavern
he used&mdash;the Bedford Head, Maiden Lane,
Covent Garden: a skilful Draughtsman,
this Mr. Hogarth, but very Uppish and
Impudent in his Tone; for I remember that
he once called me Captain Compound,
seeing, as the fellow said, that I was made
up of three&mdash;Captain Bobadil, Captain
Macheath, and Captain Kyd),&mdash;this Mr. H.
went down to St. Alban's, and took a picture
of the old Lord, as he sat in his great chair,
counting the strength of the Scottish clans
on his fingers. 'Twas afterwards graved on
copper, and had a prodigious sale.</p>

<p>Monday, March 9th, began this Lord's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Trial, very Grand and Stately, which took
place in Westminster Hall, fitted up anew
for the occasion, with the Throne, and chairs
for the Prince and the Duke, brave in
Velvet and Gold, Scarlet benches for the
Peers, galleries for Ladies and Foreign Ambassadors,
boxes for the Lawyers and the
Managers of the House of Commons that
preferred the Impeachment, and a great
railed platform, that was half like a Scaffold
itself, for the Prisoner. So we Warders,
and a Strong Guard of Horse Grenadiers
and Foot-Soldiers, brought him down from
the Tower to Westminster, Mr. Fowler, the
Gentleman Gaoler, attending with the Axe;
but the Edge thereof turned away from his
Lordship. The Crown Lawyers, Sir William
Yonge, Sir Dudley Rider, and Sir John
Strange, that were of Counsel for the
Crown, opened against him in a very bitter
manner; at which the Old Sinner grinned,
and likened them to hounds fighting for a
very tough Morsel which was scarce worth
the Tearing. Then he plagues the Lord
Steward for permission for Counsel to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
granted to him to speak on his behalf,
which by law could not be granted, and for
a short-hand writer to take minutes, which,
after some delay, was allowed. One Schield,
that was the first Witness called, deposing
that Lord Lovat made one of a company of
gentlemen who in 1740 drank healths and
sang catches, such as "Confusion to the
White Horse" (meaning the heraldic cognizance
of Hanover) "and all his generation,"
and</p>

<div class='poem'>
"When Jemmy comes o'er,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We shall have blood and blows galore,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>my Lord cries out upon him as a False
Villain and Perjured Rascal. And was
thereupon admonished by the Lord Steward
to more decorous behaviour. Item: that
he laid all the blame of the Frasers rising
upon his Son, saying with Crocodile Tears
that he was not the first who had an Undutiful
Son; whereupon the young gentleman
cries out in natural Resentment that
he would put the Saddle on the right Horse.
But this and many other charges were
brought home to him, and that he had long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
foregathered with the Pretender, of whom
he spoke in a mock-tragedy style as "the
young man Thomas Kuli Khan." When
upon his defence, he told many Lies, and
strove to Butter their Lordships with specious
Compliments and strained Eulogies;
but 'twould not serve. The Lords being
retired into their own chamber, and the
question being put whether Simon Lord
Lovat was guilty of all the charges of high
treason brought against him, every one,
laying his hand on his left breast, and beginning
with the Junior Baron, answered,
"<span class="smcap">Guilty</span>, upon my honour." And the next
day, which was the seventh of the Trial, he
was solemnly sentenced to Die as a Traitor;
his Grace the Lord Steward making a most
affecting Speech, in which he reproached the
Lord at the Bar with having unnaturally
endeavoured to cast the blame of his malpractices
on his son; "which," said his
Grace, "if it be true, is an impiety that
makes one tremble: for, to quote a wise
author of antiquity, the love of our country
includes all other social affections, which,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
he continued, "shows a perfect knowledge
of human nature; for we see, when that is
gone, even the tenderest of all affections&mdash;the
parental&mdash;may be extinguished with it."
Upon which Admirable Discourse my fellow-Warder,
Miles Bandolier, fell a blubbering,
and wiping his eyes with his laced sleeve,
whimpers that it is something, after all, to
be a Lord to be cast for Death in such
Sweet Terms; for no Judge at the Old
Bailey would think of wasting Sugared
words upon the rogue he sent to Tyburn.
Which is true.</div>

<p>When all was done, and the Lord Steward
had, by breaking his Staff, declared the
commission void, the Prisoner with a
grimace twinkling about his wicked old
mouth, bespoke his Majesty's good consideration,
and, turning to the Managers of
the Commons, cries out, "I hope, as ye are
stout, ye will be merciful!" Upon which
one Mr. Polwhedlyan, that sate for a Cornish
borough, and was a very Fat Man, thinking
himself directly concerned, shook his head
with great gravity of countenance. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the old Villain was but Play-acting again,
and could but see that the Game was up;
for as the Lords were filing back to the
House, he calls after them, "God bless you
all! I bid you an everlasting farewell, for
in this place we shall never meet again."
He said "God bless you!" with a kind of
fiendish yowl quite horrible to behold; and
if ever man's benison sounded like a curse,
it was that of bad old Lord Lovat.</p>

<p>A very sad sight at this memorable Trial
was the Appearance and Demeanour of
J. Murray, of Broughton, Esq., that had
been the Chevalier's Secretary,&mdash;deepest of
all in his Secrets, and most loved and trusted
by him. The unhappy man, to save his
Life, had betrayed his master and turned
King's Evidence, not only against Lord
Lovat, but many other unhappy Gentlemen.
I never saw such a shrinking, cowering,
hang-dog figure as was made by this Person
in the Box; and burned with shame within
myself to think that this should be a Man
of Gentle birth, and that had touched the
hand of a King's Son&mdash;Grandson, I mean.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Accomplished scoundrel as Lovat was, even
a deeper abhorrence was excited by this
Judas: when he first stood up, the Lords,
after gazing at him for a moment with
Contempt, turned their Backs upon him.
The Crown Lawyers treated him in the
manner that an Old Bailey Counsellor
would cross-examine an approver in a case
of Larceny; and as for the Prisoner, he just
shut his eyes while Murray was giving
evidence; and when he had finished, turns
to the Gentleman Gaoler, and asks, with his
eyes still shut, "Is <span class="smcap">It</span> gone?" meaning
Judas. At which there was some merriment.</p>

<p>'Twas just a month after this trial, on
April 9th, that Justice was done upon Simon
Fraser. He had eaten and drunk heartily,
and cracked many scurril Jokes while under
sentence, and seemed not to care Twopence
whether he was Reprieved or Not. On the
fatal day he waked about three in the
morning, and prayed, or pretended to pray,
with great Devotion. At all events, we
Warders heard him; and he made Noise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
enough. At five he rose, and called for a
glass of Wine-and-Water, after drinking
which he Read till seven. Then he took
some more Wine-and-Water, and at eight
desired that his Wig might be sent to the
Barber to be combed out genteelly. Also,
among some nicknacks that he kept in a
casket, he looked out a purse made somewhat
in the Scotch fashion, of sealskin, to
hold the money which he desired to give to
the Executioner. At half after nine he
breakfasted very heartily of Minced Veal,
which he hoped would not indigest, he facetiously
remarked, ordering Chocolate and
Coffee for his Friends, whose Health he
drank himself in Wine-and-Water. At
eleven the Sheriffs sent to demand his Body,
when he desired all present, save we who
were at the Door, to retire, that he might
say a short prayer. Presently he calls 'em
again, saying, "I am ready." At the
bottom of the first Pair of Stairs from his
Chamber, General Williamson, the Commandant
of the Garrison, invited him into
his room to rest himself. He complied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
most cheerfully, and in French desired that
he might be allowed to take leave of his
Lady, and thank her for all the civilities&mdash;for
she had sent him victuals every day
from her own Table, dressed in the French
fashion, which he much affected&mdash;which she
had shown him during his confinement.
But the General told him, likewise in
French, that she was too much afflicted by
his Lordship's Misfortunes to bear the
shock of parting with him, and so begged
to be excused. Which means, that she did
not care about being pawed and mauled by
this wicked Old Satyr in his last Moments;
though, with the curiosity natural to her
Sex, I saw with my own eyes Madame Williamson,
in a new Hoop and a grand silk
Calash, and with half-a-dozen of her gossips,
at a window of the House on Tower Hill
hard by the Sheriff's and overlooking the
Scaffold.</p>

<p>Now we Warders closed up about him;
and preceded and followed by Foot-Soldiers,
he was conveyed in the Governor's Coach to
the Outward Gate, and so delivered over to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the Sheriffs, who, giving a Receipt for his
Body, conveyed him in another coach (hired
for the two former Lords, Kilmarnock and
Balmerino) to the said House close to the
Scaffold, in which (the House) was a room
lined with Black Cloth and hung with
Sconces.</p>

<p>A gentleman of a Pious Mien here beginning
to read a Prayer for him, he bade me
help him up that he might Kneel. One of
the Sheriffs then asked him if he would take
a Glass of Wine; but he said that he would
prefer Negus. But there was no warm
water, unhappily, at hand, and says his
Lordship, with his old Grin, "The warm
bluid is nae tappit yet;" so they brought
him a glass of burnt brandy-and-bitters,
which he drank with great Gusto.</p>

<p>He desired that all his Clothes should be
given to his friends, together with his Corpse,
remarking that for such end he would give
the Executioner Ten instead of Five guineas,
which is the customary Compliment. To
each of the dozen Warders there present he
gave a Jacobus; to Miles Bandolier fifty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
shillings; and on myself, who had specially
attended on him ever since he was first
brought to the Tower, he bestowed Five
gold pieces. As I touched the money, he
clapped me on the shoulder, and says in his
comical way,</p>

<p>"I warrant, now, that beef and pudding
would sit as easy under thy laced jerkin were
'J. R.,' and not 'G. R.,' blazoned on thee,
back and breast."</p>

<p>But anon a light cloud passed over his
visage, and I heard him mutter to himself
in the Scottish dialect, "Beef and pudding!
'tis cauld kail for Fraser the morn."</p>

<p>Then turning to the Sheriffs, he desired
that his Head might be received in a Cloth
and put into the Coffin, the which they promised
him; likewise that (if it could be done
without censure) the ceremony of holding up
the Head at the Four Corners of the Scaffold
should be dispensed with. His Lordship
seemed now indeed very weak in his Body,
albeit in no way disconcerted as to his Mind;
and, as Miles Bandolier and your Humble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Servant escorted him up the steps of the
Scaffold, he looked around, and gazing upon
the immense concourse of people,</p>

<p>"God save us!" says he; "why should
there be such a bustle about taking off ane
gray head, that cannot get up Three Steps
without Three Bodies to support it?"</p>

<p>From which it will be seen that his Lordship
had a Merry Humour unto the last.</p>

<p>No sooner was he on the fatal Platform
than, seeing me (as he condescended to think)
much dejected, he claps me on the shoulder
again, saying, "Cheer up thy heart, laddie
in scarlet. I am not afraid; why should
you?"</p>

<p>Then he asks for the Executioner,&mdash;that
was none other, indeed, than Jack Ketch,
the Common Hangman, dressed up in black,
with a Mask on, for the days of Gentlemen
Headsmen have long since passed away;
though some would have it that this was a
Surgeon's Apprentice, that dwelt close to
their Hall in the Old Bailey, and turned
Executioner for a Frolic; but I am sure it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
was Ketch, for he came afterwards to the
Stone Kitchen, wanting to treat all present
to Drink; but the meanest Grenadier there
would have none of the Hangman's liquor,
for all that the Blood on his jerkin was that
of a Lord; and the fellow grew so impertinent
at last, that we Warders were constrained
to turn him out of the Fortress, and forbid
him to return under pain of a Drubbing.
"I shall see you no more in the Tower,"
quoth the impudent rascal; "but, by &mdash;&mdash;,
you shall all of you meet me at Tyburn some
day, and I'll sell your laced doublets in
Rosemary Lane after that your throttles are
twisted." But to resume. Lord Lovat
gave this murderous wretch with the Axe
Ten Guineas in a Purse. Then he felt the
edge of the Instrument itself, and said very
quietly that he "thought it would do."
Soon after, he rose from an Armchair which
had been placed for him, and walks round
and round his Coffin, which was covered with
Black Velvet, studded with Silver Nails, and
this Inscription on it (the which I copied off
on my Tablets at the time):<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<span class="smcap">Simon Dominus Fraser de Lovat,</span><br />

</div>

<div class='unindent'>Then he sat down again, and recited some
Latin words which I did not understand, but
was afterwards told they were from Horace,
and signified that it is a sweet and proper
thing to Die for one's Country; at the
which a Wag in one of the Gazettes of the
time must needs turn this decorous Sentiment
into Ridicule, and compose an Epigram
insulting Misfortune, to this Effect:&mdash;</div>

<div class='unindent'>Then did the unfortunate Nobleman desire all
the people to stand off except his two Warders,
who again supported him while he prayed;
after which he calls up his Solicitor and Agent
in Scotland, Mr. Wm. Fraser, and, presenting
his Gold-headed Cane to him, said, "I
deliver you this cane in token of my sense
of your faithful services, and of my committing
to you all the power I have upon
earth;" which is a Scotch fashion, I believe,
when they are Executed. And with this he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
kissed him upon both cheeks; for this Lord
was much given to hugging and slobbering.</div>

<p>He also calls for Mr. James Fraser, likewise
a Kinsman (and these Northern Lords
seem to have them by Hundreds), and says,
"My dear Jamie, I'm gaun to Haiv'n; but
ye must e'en crawl a wee langer in this evil
Warld." And with this, the old Grin.</p>

<p>Then he took off his Hat, Wig, and
Upper Clothes, and delivered them to Mr.
W. F., charging him to see that the Executioner
did not touch them. He ordered his
Nightcap to be put on, and unloosing his
Neckcloth and the Collar of his Shirt, he
kneeled down at the Block, and pulled the
Cloth which was to receive his Head close
to him; but he being too near that fatal
Billet, the Executioner desired him to remove
a little further Back, which, with our
assistance, was Immediately done; and his
Neck being properly placed, he told the
Headsman he would say a short Prayer,
and then give the Signal by dropping his
Handkerchief. In this posture he remained
about Half a Minute. Then, throwing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
down the Kerchief, the Executioner, at <span class="smcap">one
Blow</span>, severed his Head from his Body.
Then was a dreadful Crimson Shower of
Gore all around; and many and many a
time at the Playhouse have I thought upon
that Crimson Cascade on Tower Hill, when,
in the tragedy of <i>Macbeth</i>, the wicked Queen
talks of "the old man having so much blood
in him."</p>

<p>The Corpse was put into the Coffin, and
so into the Hearse, and was carried back to
the Tower. At four o'clock came an Undertaker
from Holborn Hill, very fine, with
many mourning coaches full of Scots gentlemen,
and fetched away the Body, in order
to be sent to Scotland, and deposited in his
own Tomb at Kirkhill. But leave not being
given by Authority as was expected, it was
again brought back to the Tower, and buried
by the side of Kilmarnock and Balmerino,
close to the Communion-rails in the little
church of St. Peter-on-the-Green, where so
much Royal and Noble Dust doth moulder
away.</p>

<p><i>Memorandum.</i>&mdash;The Block on which this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Nobleman suffered was but a common Billet
of Oak wood, such as Butchers use, and
hollowed out for the purpose of accommodating
the neck; but it had not been stowed
away in the White Tower for a month
before it was shown to the Public for Money,
and passed as the Block whereon Queen
Anne Boleyn was beheaded. So with the
Axe, which was declared to be the one used
in decapitating K. C. 1<sup>st</sup>; but there's not a
word of truth in the whole story. The
Block was hewn and the Axe was forged
after the '45, and specially for the doing of
justice on the Rebel Lords.</p>

<p>Note also that Lord Lovat left it in a
Codicil to his Will that all the Pipers from
Jonie Groat's house to Edinburgh were to
play before his Corpse, and have a handsome
allowance in Meal and Whisky (on
which this sort of People mostly live) for
so doing. Likewise that all the good old
Women of his county were to sing what
they call a <i>Coronach</i> over him. And indeed
Women, both young and old, are so good
when there's any thing pitiful to be done,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
that I make no doubt that the <i>Coronach</i>
would have been sung if the old Rebel had
gone back to Scotland; and if there were
found those to weep for Nero, I see no
reason why some tears should not have been
shed for Simon, Lord Lovat.</p>

<p>But there is no denying, after all, that
Simon Fraser was a very complete Scoundrel.
His whole life, indeed, had been but
one series of Crimes, one calendar of Frauds,
one tissue of Lies. For at least seventy
out of his eighty years of life he had been
cheating, cogging, betraying, and doing the
Devil's service upon earth; and who shall
say that his end was undeserved? A Scots
Lord of his acquaintance was heard to say
that he deserved to be hung twenty times in
twenty places for twenty heinous Crimes
that he had committed; and let this be
borne in mind, that this was the same Lord
Lovat that, as Captain Fraser, and being
then a Young Man, was outlawed for a very
atrocious Act of Violence that he had committed
upon a young Lady of Fashion and
Figure, whom he carried away (with the aid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of a Band of his brutal Retainers) in the
dead of night, married by Force, with the
assistance of a hireling Priest of his, cutting
the very clothes off her body with his Dirk,
and bidding his Pipers strike up to drown
her cries. And yet such a Ruffian as he
undoubtedly was could maintain an appearance
of a facete disposition to the last; and
he seems to have taken great pains to quit
the Stage, not only with Decency, but with
that Dignity which is thought to distinguish
the Good Conscience and the Noble
Mind. There is only one more thing to be
set down, and that is one that I, being the
Warder who (with Bandolier) attended him
throughout his confinement, can vouch for
the truth of. It was falsely said at the
time that this Lord sought to defraud the
Axe by much drinking of Wine: now I can
aver that while in custody he never drank
above two pints a day; and the report may
have arisen from the considerable quantities
of Brandy and Rum which were used, night
and morning, to bathe his poor feet and
legs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Tranquillity being happily restored
to these Kingdoms, and the Chevalier safely
gotten away to France (whither, however,
that luckless young Man was expelled, and
in a very ignominious manner, at the Peace
of Aix-la-Chapelle), I do confess that I began
to weary somewhat of my fine Red Doublet,
and of the Rosettes in my shoes; and
although my Loyalty to King George and
the Protestant Succession was without stain,
I felt that it was somewhat beneath the
dignity of a Gentleman Cavalier to dangle
all day beneath a Portcullis with a Partisan
on one's shoulder, or act as Bear Leader to
the Joskins and simpering City Madams
that came to see the Curiosities. And I
felt my own roaming Fit come upon me as
fierce as ever, and longed to be off to Foreign
Parts again. I could have taken service
under the Duke of Cumberland in the wars
of Germany, and could have procured, perhaps,
a pair of Colours in his Royal Highness's
army; but, odd to relate, ever since
my Misadventure at Vienna what time I
was in little Squire Pinchin's service, I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
conceived a great Distaste for those High
Dutch countries, and cared not to go a
campaigning there. Then there was fighting
going on, and to spare, in Italy, where
the Austrians were doing their best to
reduce Genoa, the French opposing 'em
tooth and nail. But I misliked the Germans
as well as their country, and saw not
the Profit of getting shot under the command
of an Austrian Archduke. There
were many other Continental countries open
to the enterprise of Gentlemen Adventurers
from England, but in most of them only
Papists would go down; and to turn Romanist,
for whatever reward of Place or
Dignity, was against my principles.</p>

<p>Pending, however, my coming to some
Determination as to my future mode of life,
I resolved to throw up my Post of Tower
Warder receiving the gratuity of Twenty
Guineas which was granted to those resigning
by the bounty of his Majesty the King.
Those who state that I left my Employment
in any thing like Disgrace are surely the
vilest Traducers and Libellers that ever deserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
to have their tongues bored through
with a Red-hot Iron; but I do not mind
myself admitting that my situation had
become somewhat unpleasant, and that I
was sufficiently anxious to change the scene
of my Adventures. There was a certain
Waiting-maid belonging to Madam Williamson
(that was General Williamson's lady,
Military Commandant) who had long cast
Sheep's Eyes upon me. I declare that I
gave the Lass no encouragement; but what
would you have? I was in the prime of
life, and she a buxom kind of Wench, about
twenty-two years of age. 'Twas following
me here, and ogling me there, and leaving
love-billets and messages for me at the
Guard-Room. I will not deny but that
from time to time I may have passed a jest
with the girl, nay, given her some few trinkums,
and now and then treated her to chocolate
or sweet wine at Marylebone Gardens
or the Flask at Hampstead. You may be
sure that on these occasions I did not wear
my Antiquated costume as a Tower Warder,
but a blue Culloden frock, gold-corded, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
with crown buttons; a scarlet waistcoat and
breeches; a hat with a military cock; and
a neat hanger by my side. By drawers,
masters of the games, and others, I was now
always known as Captain.</p>

<p>Had I not been exceedingly wary and circumspect
in all my dealings with this Waiting-Woman,&mdash;poor
thing! her name was
Prue,&mdash;the affair might have ended badly;
and there might have been Rendezvous on
the ramparts, moonlight trysts on the Tower
Green, and the like Follies. But I saw that
our Flirtation must not be permitted to go
any further. The Commandant's wife, indeed,
had come to hear of it; and, sending
for me to her Parlour, must needs ask me
what my Intentions were towards her Maid.
"Madam," I answered, taking off my hat,
and making her a very low bow, "I am a
soldier; and I never knew a soldier yet that
Intended any thing; all he does is without
any Intention at all." Upon which she
bade me to go for an Impudent fellow; and
I doubt not, had I been under her Husband's
orders, would have had me set upon the Picket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
on the Parade for my free speaking; but we
Tower Warders were not amenable to such
Slavish Discipline; and, indeed, General
Williamson, who stood by, was pleased to
laugh heartily at my answer, and gave me a
crown to drink the King's health, bidding
me, however, take care what I was about,
and see that the poor girl came to no Hurt.
And I being at that time somewhat chary
of imperilling my Independence, and minded
to take neither a Wife nor a Mistress, thought
the very best thing I could do was to kiss,
shake hands, and Part, lest worse should
come of it.</p>
